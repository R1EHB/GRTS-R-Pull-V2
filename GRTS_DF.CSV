"5","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The purpose of the project is to purchase a litter spreader and make it available to district cooperators.  The objective of this project will be to use the spreader as a nutrient management tool.

Objectives
A chicken litter spreader will be purchased for use by local land users to apply chicken litter to pasture and cropland in Yell County.  90% of the chicken litter will be applied to pastureland.  The spreader will reduce water quality degradation on poultry farms while improving/enhancing soil protection cover on cattle and row crop farms.  The spreader will be used by poultry producers to move winter time “cake-out” litter to dry storage stacking sheds instead of spreading on wet or frozen ground.  This same machine will be used during growing season to move litter from sheds/houses and safely applied on growing vegetation.  Spreader will also be used by cattle and row crop farmers to apply on their fields (traditionally very low in “P”) the litter they purchased from poultry producers that is traditionally very high in “P”.

In summary the spreader will provide a readily available economical alternative for moving litter from “high risk” poultry farms to “low risk” cattle and row crop farms.


Methods
Success will be measured by the number of acres and tons of chicken litter that is applied, and by the number of land users that use the spreader.  

We estimate that we will have 15 users the first year, 25 in year 2 and 35 after 3 years.

The litter spreader will be advertised in the local weekly paper and in all publications of the district newsletter.  The district’s WQT will supply land users information detailing the proper application and timing of spreading the litter .

Livingston School Districts 4 and 1 are proposing to create a mobile water laboratory to conduct watershed study activities in the field or in close proximity to streams and rivers, namely Fleshman Creek and the Yellowstone River in Park County. The laboratory will be built inside a 8.5 x 32 feet bumper pull cargo trailer with 4600 pounds of carrying capacity. At the time of purchase, the trailer will feature four 30"" x 30"" windows, rear double doors, RV style curb-side walk-in door, LED lights, plywood walls inside, and a plywood floor. Upon fabrication of the trailer, it will feature solar panels and inverters, a generator, receptacles, storage areas, and 14 work stations. The Districts are requesting 319 funding to support the purchase of the trailer, solar panels and inverters, generator, and construction materials. The Districts, specifically students and teachers in the Industrial Technology, Agricultural Education and Future Farmers of America (FFA), and Art Departments, are proposing to fabricate the trailer into the laboratory. Teachers and students in the Industrial Technology and Agricultural Education and FFA Departments will complete all drafting, wiring, carpentry, and welding activities. Teachers and students in the Art Department will complete all exterior design and painting activities. Once fabricated, the Districts will supply the laboratory with equipment they own, including: mini laptop computers, Vernier probe ware, Global Water water-quality monitoring probes (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH) and radio transmitter, GPA units, and microscopes. 

Objectives
One objective that can be measured and accomplished during the project period (15 months) is the actual fabrication of the mobile water laboratory. While they probably cannot be measured during the project period, other objectives of the project include: making water curriculum more practical oriented, making the instruction model more interactive and student centered, and making the learning environment more engaging. The Districts anticipate that the laboratory will improve classroom flexibility, affect positively on classroom practice, student motivation, and participation. Additionally, the laboratory may encourage more students to pursue careers in watershed stewardship.

The goal of this long-term program is to provide objective, credible data to decision makers in the Powder basin and engage stakeholders in monitoring their watersheds.

Objectives
The ultimate purpose of the volunteer 2 year monitoring program is two-fold: to engage stakeholders in on-the-ground activities that lead to a better understanding of watershed condition, and to obtain relevant objective water quality and watershed condition data. We hope that successful volunteer engagement will extend into the long term program we envision.
Our primary goal is to establish a long-term volunteer monitoring program that provides objective, credible data to decision makers in the Powder Basin and promote stakeholder engagement in monitoring watershed condition. 
Specific monitoring objectives for the first 2 years are:
1.	Detect changes in 7 day max water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, and turbidity greater than 10% at 10 locations using continuous data.
2.	Detect exceedances in 7 day max water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, and turbidity standards at 10 locations using field data collection.
3.	Detect visual changes to stream channels, streambanks, and riparian vegetation at 25 locations through seasonal photo monitoring.


Methods
	Plan strategically, prioritizing for instream and riparian projects to maintain and improve freshwater aquatic habitats, water quality and stream flow that affect native fishes, i.e. Bull and Redband trout.
	Address the parameters that are limiting watershed function and ecological diversity.
	Identify trends (changes) in habitat conditions so that we can maximize healthy populations of plant and animal species.

"15","items",NA,"CO",89086,"Identifying Arkansas River Selenium and Nitrogen Best Management","$256,620","Overview
Since publication of the current Lower Arkansas Watershed Plan in 2008, major advances in the understanding of Se speciation, chemical transformation, and transport in Colorado’s Lower Arkansas River Valley (LARV) have been achieved under recent NPS projects.   Progress also has been made in describing and predicting N cycling and the transport of nitrate (NO3), a compound which also affects Se, in the LARV.    This project will provide detailed amendment to the current Lower Arkansas Watershed Plan by describing specific strategies to solve some key water quality issues in the LARV.  Elevated loadings and concentrations of both selenium (Se), a key target constituent in the current watershed plan, and nitrogen (N), an emerging problem contaminant in the LARV, in groundwater and surface waters in the LARV will be addressed. 

The overall goal is to enhance the Lower Arkansas Watershed Plan by detailing BMPs, and outlining a means for their future pilot implementation, which will aid in diminishing the mass loadings and concentration of Se and N in the surface waters of the LARV and bring them into conformity with regulatory standards. This will involve using modeling tools to investigate practical, economically-viable, and socially-acceptable BMPs, as identified in collaboration with stakeholders and the watershed community. For both pollutants, in-stream concentrations will be the main targeted criteria since total maximum daily loads (TMDL) currently are not available for the impaired segments of the Arkansas River. Parallel goals include those specified in the current watershed plan, such as maintaining and enhancing beneficial uses in the watershed, maintaining and enhancing overall habitat diversity, and promoting good stewardship of water resources among the watershed community.


Objectives
Objective 1:  Identify representative key stakeholders in the LARV and form a stakeholder group to guide the planning process, facilitate communication, and promote community involvement.

Objective 2: Characterize and assess current watershed conditions in relation to Se and N, and develop a plan that provides for delineation and eventual implementation of BMPs to enhance conditions in relation to specified criteria.

Objective 3: Manage the project in accordance with all federal, state, and organization funding requirements and report on project implementation.


Methods
Task 1:  Identify key stakeholders in the LARV through an assessment of local elected officials, extension offices, soil and water conservation districts, water conservancy districts, National Resources Conservation Service, parks and recreation services, state fish and wildlife programs, landowners, canal companies, CWQCD, and other water and resource management agencies. 

Task 2:  Establish forums of communication with stakeholders and the broader watershed community, in order to identify issues of concern, establish specific goals of the watershed plan related to Se and N, and propose and discuss feasible management strategies.  

Task 3:  Collate, store and analyze data to identify water quality concerns, in order to identify geographic regions of highest concern.  

Task 4:  Estimate the magnitude, source locations, and timing of pollutant loading under existing watershed conditions. 

Task 5:  Establish a set of feasible BMPs. 

Task 6:  Prepare a preliminary plan for a pilot implementation and assessment program, with a timeline for BMP adoption and evaluation. This also includes proposed mechanisms for adapting and funding. 

Task 7:  Prepare a report describing the proposed BMPs, their expected impact, and a preliminary plan for pilot implementation. Before publication, a draft will be given to stakeholders, CWQCD personnel, and interested watershed residents for potential feedback; and appropriate refinement will be made.

Task 8:  Ensure that objectives and tasks are accomplished within the estimated schedule; ensure compliance with general procedures and protocol described in the project implementation plan; maintain accounting and matching funds records; and ensure that costs are kept within specified budgetary guidelines.

Task 9:   Hold progress report meetings, complete semi-annual reports, final reports, and reimbursement requests within the prescribed schedule.  Where appropriate, prepare refereed journal articles documenting key findings.

"16","items",NA,"ME",62920,"#2010RR05, Pattee Pond Watershed NPS Reduction Project, Phase I","$59,450","Overview
The Pattee Pond Watershed has a direct watershed of approximately 6,430 acres and is located primarily in Winslow, with small portions of the watershed in Albion, China and Vassalboro.  The watershed is a sub-watershed of the Sebasticook River . Pattee Pond (515 acres) makes up the pond portion of the watershed, is approximately 8% of the total watershed and consists of a shallow, dimictic lake fed through a network of streams, ditches, and overland flow.  Two primary inlets are its largest contributors: Bellows Stream (flowing through Emery Swamp) and Prentice Brook (originating from Mud Pond).  Pattee Pond has a mean depth of 15 feet, a maximum depth of 29 feet; and a flushing rate of 2.72 flushes per year.  Land use is agricultural forested land 8.69%, with 8% of the watershed covered with water.  The remaining 83.29% is split between non-developed land (78.86%) and developed areas (4.43%).  
	
The MDEP has placed Pattee Pond on the Maine DEP Nonpoint Source Priority Watershed List and it is on the Chapter 502, MDEP List of Lakes Most at Risk from New Development.  The shoreline is dotted with over 105 seasonal and 5 year-round residences.  A private campground and boys camp are located along the Pattee Pond shoreline.  These two commercial establishments annually service over 300 public users and the campground has public boat access available for a small fee.  The pond provides valuable habitat for a variety of flora and fauna, such as bald eagles, ospreys, loons, blue herons, otters, and beaver.  The abundance of large and small mouth bass,  white and yellow perch and periodically stocked brown trout makes the pond a great fishing location.      

With assistance from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) and the KCSWCD, in fall/winter of 2007/2008 Pattee Pond Association (PPA) completed a watershed survey to identify nonpoint problems.  This effort was supported by a team of 22 volunteers from a variety of community partners including the PPA, AmeriCorps, Unity College, and technical staff from the MDEP and the KCSWCD. 

Water quality monitoring data has been collected for Pattee Pond by the MDEP and the Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program (VLMP) monitors for the last 35+ years.  Pattee Pond is a eutrophic colored lake (average color 40 SPU) with an average Secchi Disk Transparency of 2.8m.  The range of the water column TP for Pattee Pond is 12-26 ppb with an average of 19 ppb, while Chla ranges from 1.0 –21.2 ppb; dissolved oxygen profiles show moderate DO depletion in the deep areas of the lake and the potential for nuisance algal blooms is high (MDEP, Water Quality Summary).   Water quality is considered to be below average compared to other Maine lakes.  Although the pond has shown improvement since the 1970s, it still experiences algal blooms.  

The 2007/2008 watershed survey identified 97 sites that are impacting or have the potential to impact the water quality of the pond.  Of these sites, 57% were in residential areas, 22% were on private roads, 8% were driveways, 7% were boat accesses, and 6% were other.  High and medium impact sites made up 51% of the residential sites and 76% of the private road sites.
During summer and fall, 2008, nineteen Colby College environmental students conducted a Water Quality and Watershed Analysis of Pattee Pond, finding that:  1) erosion into Prentice Brook/Farber Brook is a significant source of sediment loading into Pattee Pond; 2) the three main anthropogenic sources of phosphorus in the watershed are residential development, septic systems, and roads; and 3) almost one half of the camp road surfaces around Pattee Pond require substantial repair to reduce runoff into the pond.  Whitefish Road and Pickerel Point Road are two camp roads of particular concern.  The study also noted that the pond is expected to respond rapidly to mitigation techniques for phosphorus loading because of its high flushing rate.


Objectives
The project purpose is to reduce the amount of NPS pollutants reaching surface waters in the Pattee Pond watershed.  Sediment and phosphorous are the target sources for reduction. This project will implement BMPs on 24 medium and high priority NPS work sites and will reduce erosion-related impacts by an estimated 10.45 tons of sediment annually.

Methods
This project will reduce sediment loading by remediating 24 high and medium impact sites as identified in the 2007/2008 watershed survey.  KCSWCD will oversee the NPS site selection, design BMPs for the roadways and oversee installation for more technical sites.  The PPA will select representatives to receive training provided by the KCSWCD.  These volunteers will provide ‘first contact’ technical assistance to a minimum of 30 property owners and will develop BMP recommendations and site plans for residential remediation.  The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) and volunteers from the PPA will perform the work on these sites via six organized work sessions.  These project sites will include 13 technical ly advanced sites requiring heavy equipment to construct 41 BMPs, and 11 less technical ‘shovel and rake’ sites to construct 35 BMPs.  These sites will include private roads, driveways, residential properties, and a commercial property.  PPA will provide 4 workshops addressing:  1) buffers, 2) road and driveway BMPs, 3) pathway installation, rain gardens, and other residential BMPs, and 4) a septic social with the town CEO.  PPA will also organize training for middle school educators in the watershed area through Project WET.  Sites around the pond will be used to demonstrate watershed curriculum issues with future students.  Further outreach will be provided through news releases, the PPA, and KCSWCD newsletters, an end-of-project brochure, and two mailings to the watershed property owners.  YCC will be established under the direction of the town’s recreation department, which already uses high school students for summer work projects.  The town will also provide the essential administrative and fiduciary personnel for handling the receipts and payments and various reports needed during the project.
	
A second phase of funding will be needed to further reduce sediment loading by remediating erosion problems on the remaining 3 high impact and 31 medium impact sites.  These sites each require multiple BMPs and include several private boat access points.

In managing this project NPS Program grant funds will not be used to undertake, complete or maintain erosion or storm water control work otherwise required by existing permits or orders.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Otter Creek Watershed is located in Piute County. Utah between longitude -112° 5' 34"" on the west and -111° 41'49"" on the east and between latitude 38° 42'29"" on the north and latitude 38° 7' 42"" on the south.  The watershed encompasses 240,000 acres (375 sq mi) of rangeland, forest, irrigated pasture, irrigated cropland, meadow pasture, and small urban areas. The watershed is about 39 miles long and 12 miles wide. Otter Creek is a tributary to the East Fork of the Sevier River, running the length of Grass Valley from north to south into Otter Creek Reservoir. Otter Creek drains the east slope of Parker Mountain and the west slope of Monroe Mountain. Planned project activities include the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) on private and public lands to reduce sediment, nutrients and coliform, and to improve fish and wildlife habitat. Planned BMPs are those directed toward increased vegetative cover along Otter Creek, range improvement, irrigation water management, grazing management, stream stabilization, stream bank protection, improved riparian areas and improvement of public recreation facilities.

"21","items",NA,"UT",23102,"Middle Sevier River Watershed TMDL Implementation","$104,680","Overview
Various segments of the Sevier River appear on the state of Utah’s 2002 Section 303(d) list of impaired waters.  Causes of impairment include total dissolved solids, sediment, and total phosphorus. The beneficial uses that are impaired include 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4.  Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) have been developed for waterbodies in the middle and lower Sevier River and have been approved by the EPA in August of 2004.  In addition, several TMDLs for total phosphorus are being developed for Koosharem, Lower Box, and Otter Creek reservoirs.   The Sevier Soil Conservation District has recently hired a watershed coordinator to develop a watershed plan and coordinate restoration and management activities intended to meet the endpoints of the TMDL.  Although a comprehensive watershed plan is still under development, the TMDL has address all water quality parameters of concern and made detailed recommendations for reducing nonpoint sources of pollution.  This project is designed to address a number of major contributors to impairments in the watershed including irrigation efficiency, streambank stabilization, and animal waste management. This project represents the first concerted effort to implement a unified watershed restoration strategy and will have important demonstration value to educate and inform stakeholders of best management practices.

The Middle Sevier River from Rocky Ford Reservoir to its terminus near Sevier Lake was initially identified as a low priority watershed for TMDL development. However, the Division of Water Quality has developed TMDLs for its high priority watersheds and local involvement in watershed management necessitated the completion of water quality studies in the Sevier River.  The designated uses for the Middle Sevier River are 2B, 3B and 4. Designated uses in the Otter Creek watershed are 2B, 3A, and 4.  The middle and lower Sevier River  were found by Utah to be partially supporting their designated beneficial use for agriculture because of high total dissolved solids concentrations (TDS). In addition, habitat alteration, sediment and high phosphorus levels are impairing the warm water (3B) fishery in the Sevier River.   A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) analysis was submitted to the EPA in April, 2004 and approved August 17, 2004.  The Otter Creek Watershed TMDL will be submitted to EPA early in 2006.


Objectives
The overall project goals are to: Implement a suite of projects to address multiple categories of non-point source pollution in the Middle Sevier watershed by: reducing TDS loads by improving irrigation systems and irrigation water management; reducing the amount of phosphorus entering the watershed from animal feeding operations; improving the stability of the stream channels and enhancing the riparian corridor to reduce sediment, TDS, and phosphorus loading; improving upland and pastureland management practices to reduce sediment, salinity, and nutrient runoff; and informing and educating the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of managing natural resources within the watershed. These projects are the first phase of implementation activities planned for the watershed which will continue on an incremental basis for the next 4 to 5 years.    In addition, the watershed planning process will receive the support of a watershed coordinator to provide technical assistance to the Sevier River Steering Committee in developing its watershed plan and future implementation activities to address water quality problems.  The hiring of a watershed coordinator has been funded through a statewide 319 proposal to acquire funding for a number of coordinators, one of which is currently working full-time in the Middle Sevier River Watershed.  

The TMDL Water Quality Study of the Middle and Lower Sevier River (see included) identifies the primary sources of point and non-point sources of TDS pollution in the Middle Sevier River Watershed.  The allocation analysis identifies several potential sources and their corresponding load contributions.  Implementation activities funded through this project will be chosen in order to achieve the greatest load reduction possible by locating individual projects in priority source areas identified in the TMDL.  The final watershed plan will identify all related resource issues, prioritize problem areas, and target projects to address all sources of pollutants identified in the TMDL .  At this time, potential project cooperators have not been identified but final determination of suitable projects is ongoing and will be based on priorities described in section on “Selection Criteria”  Load contribution and resulting reductions from BMP implementation may not be reasonably estimated at this time. However, where feasible, the potential load reduction for the projects are noted below in the description of project goals.  Additional load reduction from BMPs will be estimated and reported into the GRTS database as information is available.

Goal #1:  Improve stability of the stream channel and enhance the riparian corridor to reduce sediment nutrient loading to the river and its tributaries

Goal #2: Assist animal feeding operations in the Middle Sevier River watershed to implement and demonstrate containment, proper application and utilization of animal manures using Best Management Practices.
.
Goal #3: Improve pasture condition and implement irrigation efficiency and management practices to reduce runoff and sources of salinity as well as identify critical species habitat.

Goal #4:  Inform and educate the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of maintaining and improving water quality within the watershed.

Methods
Selection criteria for projects under this implementation plan will be based primarily on findings in the TMDL.  For instance, pasture improvement, irrigation projects and upland sediment control will be focused in the middle and lower valley where the conditions (i.e. saline soils, flood irrigation return flows) warrant management practices. In addition, nutrient management and stream bank restoration projects will be prioritized on whether the project will result in nutrient reduction and other benefits to the 3A coldwater fishery in the upper watershed.

The following is a list of proposed BMP’s that may be used along with the information and education efforts to improve water quality in the Middle Sevier River watershed.
Cropland Practices include: irrigation water techniques and management, crop sequencing, field borders, conservation tillage and filter strips.

The Sevier River has completed a TMDL to address sources of Total Dissolved Solids, Total Phosphorus and Habitat
Alteration.  A watershed coordinator has been  hired to assist the local sponsors to implement the endpoints of the TMDL and complete a watershed
management plan. This project will address nonpoint source pollution sources identified in the TMDL in the Middle Sevier River and portions of the Otter
Creek Watershed where a TMDL for Total Phosphorus is being developed for several waterbodies. The final TMDL for Otter Creek has not been received, no projects have been outlined.  In addition, the information/education component of the PIP is intended to highlight best management practices and develop interest in restoration and conservation activites.

Objectives
Goal #1:  Improve the stability of the stream channel and banks, reduce sediment and nutrient loading to the river, and restore habitat alteration.

Goal #2:  Reduce runoff from animal feeding operations and grazing in pastures to reduce nutrient loading to surface water.

Goal #3: Improve pasture condition and replace flood irrigation with sprinkler or gated pipe systems to reduce water usage and  runoff, which will reduce sediment, dissolved solids and nutrient inputs to the river and its tributaries.

Goal #4:  Inform and educate the local communties and citizens concerning non-point source polliution and the importance of maintaining and improving water quality within the watershed.

Goal #5:  Work with the local CWMA on the control of noxius weeds problems in the watershed.

Methods
Goal #1: Improve stability of the stream channel and enhance the riparian corridor to reduce sediment, TDS and nutrient loading to the river and its tributaries.

Objective 1: Develop project to reduce sediment and nutrient loading to the river through improved function of the stream bank and riparian area.

Task 1 - Select and identify project cooperators, develop, and implement stream bank and riparian improvement plan to include grazing management and fencing as needed using BMPs and bioengineering principles (such as willow revetment, grassed waterways, willow plantings, etc.).  Selection will be prioritized for areas where fishery habitat will benefit from stream bank restoration.  Currently, approximately 10+ miles of stream bank have been identified for treatment. There is 1(one) site specific area that has been identified, East of Aurora Town (1000’) with vertical banks cutting farm away,                                 threatening farm and livestock.

Load Reduction:  Although site specific information is not available at this time, the TMDL estimated potential TSS load reduction from stabilizing the most severely eroding banks to be approximately 150,000 kg/year/mile of restored streambank.

Output: One (1) stream bank restoration project.

Total Cost: $37,667      319: $22,600      Match: $$15,067

Goal #2: Assist animal feeding operations in the Middle Sevier River watershed to implement and demonstrate containment, proper application and utilization of animal manure using Best Management Practices (BMPs) with Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs), also reconstruct and or re-locate corrals located on perennial waterway. These projects will be coordinated with other state programs to make sure we don’t duplicate. There are still some that have not been done, after the SVAP is complete on the Middle Sevier there will be additional ones identified, along with the one in Elsinore town which is located on a main canal that can drain back to the river.

Objective 1: Develop animal waste system to ensure total containment of animal manure and reduce pollutants entering the Middle Sevier River drainage.

Task 2 - Select and identify project cooperator, develop an AWM system using BMPs and CNMPs, and implement project. Priority will be given to a project that will yield benefits to the fishery in the upper river through nutrient load reductions.

Output: One (1) animal waste management system.

Load Reduction:  The TMDL did not estimate specific nutrient reductions for individual practices but targeted load reductions for animal management (~6,600 kg/year TP upstream of Yuba Reservoir).

Total Cost:  $16,700      319: $10,000      Match: $6,700

Goal #3:  Improve pasture condition and implement management practices to reduce runoff and sources of salinity as well as identify critical species habitat and Russian Olive and Tamarisk problems along the river corridor and improve irrigation techniques and management practices to reduce TDS, runoff and pullulating the river and its tributaries.

Objective 1: Reduce the contribution of non-point sources of TDS from erosion and runoff from pastures and improve irrigation techniques and management, also control and management of the                Russian Olive and Tamarisk along the river corridor, canals and on agriculture and range lands.  This will likely entail conversion from flood irrigation to sprinkler systems, or gated pipe systems.

Task 3 - Identify project cooperators, Cooperative Weed Management Area (CWMA) board, and develop irrigation water management plan using BMPs and  implement project including a combination of reseeding, weed control(Russian Olive and Tamarisk) and pasture management  This will likely be a combination of grazing management and vegetation of meadows to increase retention of irrigation water, irrigation pipeline for erosion control and improved efficiency, protecting well head areas, and reduce contribution of TDS from saline pasture lands.

Output: One (1) irrigation pipeline for erosion control, and efficiency and water control improvement.

Load Reduction:  The TMDL estimated a 0.1 kg/year/acre reduction in TP, and 550 kg/year/acre in TDS through improving pasture and range conditions in the Middle Sevier River.

Total Cost: $110,300      319: $66,200      Match: $44,100

Goal #4:  Inform and educate the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of maintaining and improving water quality within the watershed.

Various segments of the Sevier River appear on the state of Utah’s 2002 Section 303(d) list of impaired waters.  Causes of impairment include total dissolved solids, sediment, and total phosphorus. The beneficial uses that are impaired include 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4.  Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) have been developed for water bodies in the middle and lower Sevier River and was approved by the EPA in August of 2004.  In addition, the TMDLs for total phosphorus are being developed for Koosharem, Lower Box, and Otter Creek reservoirs. They were completed and approved by EPA August of 2006.The Sevier Conservation District has hired a watershed coordinator to develop a watershed plan and coordinate restoration and management activities intended to meet the endpoints of the TMDL.  Although a comprehensive watershed plan is still under development, it is hoped to be in draft form within the next year, the TMDL has addressed the water quality parameters of concern and made detailed recommendations for reducing nonpoint sources of pollution. This project is designed to address a number of major contributors to impairments in the watershed including irrigation efficiency, streambank stabilization, and animal waste management. This project represents the first concerted effort to implement a unified watershed restoration strategy and will have important demonstration value to educate and inform stakeholders of best management practices.

Objectives
The overall project goals are to: Implement a suite of projects to address multiple categories of non-point source pollution in the Middle Sevier watershed by: reducing TDS loads, by improving irrigation systems and irrigation water management; reducing the amount of phosphorus entering the watershed from animal feeding operations; improving the stability of the stream channels and enhancing the riparian corridor to reduce sediment, TDS, and phosphorus loading; improving upland and pastureland management practices to reduce sediment, salinity, and nutrient runoff; and informing and educating the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of managing natural resources within the watershed. These projects are the first phase of implementation activities planned for the watershed which will continue on an incremental basis for the next 4 to 5 years. In addition, the watershed planning process has received the support of a watershed coordinator to provide technical assistance to the Sevier River Steering Committee in developing its watershed plan and future implementation activities to address water quality problems.  The watershed coordinator has been funded through a statewide 319 proposal to acquire funding for a number of coordinators, one of which is currently working full-time in the Middle Sevier River Watershed.

Various segments of the Sevier River appear on the state of Utah’s 2002 Section 303(d) list of impaired waters.  Causes of impairment include total dissolved solids, sediment, and total phosphorus. The beneficial uses that are impaired include 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4.  Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) have been developed for water bodies in the middle and lower Sevier River and was approved by the EPA. This project represents the first concerted effort to implement a unified watershed restoration strategy and will have important demonstration value to educate and inform stakeholders of best management practices.

The Sevier River watershed is located in central and southwestern Utah.  The principal drainage in the watershed is the Sevier River and its larger tributaries: the East Fork of the Sevier River, Salina Creek, and the San Pitch River.  These tributaries and other smaller streams flowing from the surrounding hills and valley-floor springs discharge into the Sevier River.  The Sevier River, in turn, drains into Sevier Lake, a normally dry playa lake.  The Sevier River watershed covers nearly 11,000 square miles of land with significant variations in topography, climate, soils, and vegetation.  Elevations range from approximately 4,500 feet to 12,000 feet with annual precipitation ranging from 8 inches to 35 inches.  The geologic parent materials provide a wide variety of soils producing vegetation ranging from alpine conifer forest to desert shrubs and grasses.  Hydrologic modification is perhaps the most significant impact to water quantity and quality in the watershed as the Sevier River is one of the most heavily utilized rivers in the west and is a primary cause of excess salinity in the watershed.  In addition, geologic formations of shale containing high salinity represent a significant natural load of TDS to the river and its tributaries.

Objectives
The designated uses for the Middle Sevier River are 2B, 3B and 4. Designated uses in the Otter Creek watershed are 2B, 3A, and 4.  The middle and lower Sevier River were found by Utah to be partially supporting their designated beneficial use for agriculture because of high total dissolved solids concentrations (TDS). In addition, habitat alteration, sediment and high phosphorus levels are impairing the warm water (3B) fishery in the Sevier River. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) analysis was submitted to the EPA in April, 2004 and approved August 17, 2004.

Methods
The overall project goals are to: Implement a suite of projects to address multiple categories of non-point source pollution in the Middle Sevier watershed by: reducing TDS loads, by improving irrigation systems and irrigation water management; reducing the amount of phosphorus entering the watershed from animal feeding operations; improving the stability of the stream channels and enhancing the riparian corridor to reduce sediment, TDS, and phosphorus loading; improving upland and pastureland management practices to reduce sediment, salinity, and nutrient runoff; and informing and educating the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of managing natural resources within the watershed.

Over all Goals,
Goal #1:  Improve stability of the stream channel and enhance the riparian corridor to reduce sediment nutrient loading to the river and its tributaries

The NWMTLVMN currently has more than sixty volunteers that monitor fifty-three locations on forty lakes throughout the region. The goal of the program is to provide training and equipment to volunteer monitors and to develop long term trend analysis for lakes included in the program. 

The NWMTLVMN recruits volunteers throughout the year through media releases, presentations and trainings. NWMTLVMN holds three field trainings held each spring. Volunteers who participate in the program are asked to collect data twice per month at their monitoring site(s) from June through October, and submit data forms electronically through the NWMTLVMN website database.  


Objectives
In 2010, the Whitefish to Eureka VLMP combined with the FBC VLMP to form the Northwest Montana Lakes Volunteer Monitoring Network (NWMTLVMN). This brought the total number of lakes monitored by citizen volunteers to forty (40). The goal of this project is to collect long-term trend data on select lakes to support management decisions and to create public awareness of lake issues. The program provides early detection monitoring for AIS including zebra and quagga mussels, and Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM). In 2010 with funding partnership from FBC and MTFWP, WLI hired a full time coordinator for the program, and built a website to help coordinate and communicate lake monitoring efforts and be a repository for collected data. The website allows volunteers to login as a registered user and submit their baseline data directly to the database. Volunteers can also navigate the website to find links and information relevant to AIS early detection. 

Methods
Water chemistry samples and Hydrolab profiles are collected between July 15th and August 15th by the program coordinator and the volunteer for each site. Veliger sampling is also conducted within this time. 

Laboratory analysis of water samples is conducted by Energy Laboratories in Helena. Veliger samples are sent to FWP in Helena and then sent for laboratory analysis. Plant samples are sent to Montana Department of Agriculture and Montana State University Diagnostic Laboratories for analysis.

Nonpoint source pollution is the number one contributor to water pollution in Kentucky, accounting for approximately 2/3 of the impairments in Kentucky’s streams and lakes, including impairments associated with urban runoff around more populated areas and cities, agriculture, failing septic systems, straight pipes, forestry, construction, and the channelization of many streams for various purposes (2). The Four Rivers Basin has approximately 785 miles of stream partially supporting their designated use, and 600 miles of streams not supporting their designated use (1).  Education and outreach activities, watershed planning projects, and implementation projects will all be required to address these impairments in the Four Rivers Basin, and a Four Rivers Basin Coordinator is an aptly qualified individual to perform these activities.

The Four Rivers Basin Coordinator employed through this project will work with communities, watershed groups, regulatory agencies, businesses, industries and citizens in the Four Rivers Basin to improve water quality and reduce through nonpoint source pollution through the implementation of projects that will directly improve water quality, and through educational and outreach activities that will work to change the mindset of individuals and indirectly improve water quality. The basin coordinator will work hand in hand with the Kentucky Division of Water to implement the Watershed Management Framework, including the Nonpoint Source Management Program. The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team, meeting bi-monthly, to provide technical assistance for water quality projects, and outreach for local communities with water quality concerns. 

Measures of success for this project will vary with the different tasks performed by the Four Rivers Basin Coordinator, but will include projects implemented by communities, schools, businesses, industries, watershed groups, etc. that will improve water quality, educational sessions held by the coordinator, Four Rivers Basin Team meetings held by the coordinator, and development of an updated Four Rivers Basin Status Report. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve water quality and reduce nonpoint source pollution in the Four Rivers Basin through education, outreach, and project implementations, and these improvements will serve as the ultimate measure of success for this project.

Methods
The Jackson Purchase Foundation (JPF) will continue to staff the position of Four Rivers Basin Coordinator.  The Four Rivers Basin Coordinator will continue work throughout the Four Rivers Basin to accomplish the goals, objectives, and activities described in Section 16 of this project application, with an ultimate goal of improving water quality and reducing nonpoint source pollution in the Four Rivers Basin through education, outreach, and project implementation.

One of the project goals identified for this project includes the implementation of the KDOW Watershed Management Approach, including the Kentucky Nonpoint Source Management Program.  Various activities will be performed to accomplish this goal.  The basin coordinator will hold Four Rivers Basin Team meetings bi-monthly, and will work to ensure the Four Rivers Basin Team is composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds, each contributing a unique perspective to water quality management, including regulatory agencies, universities, local industries, agriculture, local governments and health departments, etc.  The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team to select priority areas for watershed protection and restoration, and then try to work with local individuals or other interested parties in those priority areas to develop projects that will improve water quality in them.  The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team to ensure that impaired and special use waters, especially those affected by nonpoint source pollution, will be adequately addressed.  Minutes from each Four Rivers Basin Team will be submitted to the KDOW Nonpoint Source Section, and the basin coordinator will facilitate communication between the different branches of the KDOW and the Four Rivers Basin Team.  The basin coordinator will also work with local watershed groups and interested individuals, helping them to focus their concerns into successful projects, and provide technical assistance to their water quality related projects, including the development, administration, and management phases of these projects.  The basin coordinator will work with these groups, both developing and established groups, to ensure successful partnerships are fostered between all stakeholders, including federal and state regulatory agencies, local governments and health departments, local industries, universities, and other nonprofit groups.

Another project goal identified for this project includes the encouragement of cooperation and communication between communities and watershed groups with similar water quality issues and water resource concerns.  Activities that will be performed to accomplish this goal will include facilitating the transfer of information between watershed groups, like the Red River Watershed Association, an established group that has performed many successful projects, and the Little River Task Force, which is a group in its infancy that could learn from the Red River Watershed Association, and between local communities facing the same issues, such as the local MS4 communities, or communities trying to address karst impacts on water quality.  The basin coordinator will also encourage the duplication and implementation of successful projects from other river basins that are applicable in the Four Rivers Region.  For example, the bacterial source tracking project performed in the Dix River Watershed in the Kentucky River Basin could be an extremely useful tool throughout the Four Rivers Basin in tracking down the source of pathogen contamination.  

A third project goal identified includes increasing awareness and support for watershed conservation throughout the Four Rivers Basin.  This goal will be accomplished through educational and outreach activities.  Some of these activities will focus on community leaders, local citizens, schools, businesses, industry and other various groups to provide information about the importance of water quality, stream protection, and watershed conservation, including actions each individual can take to protect water quality and reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Meetings and information sessions will be held with the different sectors, and will be tailored to each different sector.  The basin coordinator will meet and work with the different MS4 communities to assist with education and outreach activities, including working with these communities to develop a water quality informational booth for local festivals, and providing training and informational sessions for different MS4 related activities and regulations.  The basin coordinator will also participate in information sessions throughout the Four Rivers Basin to educate the public about watershed health, nonpoint source pollution, and activities or practices that protect our watersheds and reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Some of these sessions will include Barbeque on the River Festival in Paducah, Murray State University Sustainability Conference, Little River Days in Christian County, and various other events the basin coordinator is invited to.  The basin coordinator will update the Four Rivers Basin Status Report with current conditions for the basin, and distribute this report to citizens of the Four Rivers Basin. The basin coordinator will assist Four Rivers Watershed Watch in accomplishing their mission, by providing information to local communities and individuals about the program and their goals, helping to recruit new volunteers, and assisting with data analysis and interpretation.  The basin coordinator will attend speaking engagements to distribute information about Four Rivers Watershed Watch, and will develop public service announcements and newspaper articles to be released to local media outlets in an effort to increase volunteer support for Four Rivers Watershed Watch.

Increasing awareness of grant opportunities for water quality related projects is another goal identified for this project.  The basin coordinator will stay abreast of grant opportunities and available resources for water quality related projects, and will share this information with local watershed groups and citizens in an effort to improve water quality through project implementation.  The basin coordinator will meet with community leaders, school leaders, concerned citizens, businesses, industries or other potential applicants to notify them of different grant opportunities, including EPA 319(h) grants and other Clean Water Act funds, and assist them with project development and implementation to ensure ideas and concerns are turned into successful projects.  The basin coordinator will meet with local water and sewer districts to identify projects that could potential impact water quality and attempt to minimize the negative impacts on water quality.  The coordinator will also work with these districts to find potential sources of funding for projects that could enhance water quality, in addition to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.  The basin coordinator will attend the Water Management Council meetings help by the Purchase Area Development District and the Pennyrile Area Development District to stay knowledgeable on projects that could impact water quality throughout the Four Rivers Basin.

The last project goal identified for this project includes increasing the knowledge base of the basin coordinator in order to provide greater assistance to local communities and watershed groups.  The basin coordinator will attend monthly meetings with other basin coordinators in Kentucky to share experiences and information about the watershed approach, successful projects that have been implemented, and other useful information.  The basin coordinator will attend additional GIS training to become more familiar in GIS database development and applications in watershed management.  The basin coordinator will attend the Kentucky Watershed Leadership Academy training, if requested by the KDOW. The basin coordinator will attend various other water quality related training as it becomes available, such as stream and habitat restoration training, data collection training, best management practice training, communication training, etc.  Potential training opportunities will be cleared first through the KDOW to ensure they will be useful to the basin coordinator.

"32","items",NA,"NM",60180,"Collaborative Water Quality Improvement Project for the San Juan River Watershed, Phase III","$217,723","Overview
By implementing the Best Management Practices found in this workplan, the San Juan Watershed will benefit by a reduction in loading of E. coli, fecal coliform and plant nutrient loading to the Animas, La Plata and San Juan Rivers.  The reductions in loading, a priority of the SJWG, will improve water quality within the San Juan Watershed.

The education and outreach component of the project will provide greater awareness of the pollutant loading sources and methods to reduce impacts from those sources to the citizens of San Juan County.  The resulting public support for the rivers and voluntary implementation of pollutant reduction techniques by local residents will provide greater protection for the rivers and water quality improvements.

The outreach effort will also increase local awareness of the SJWG and our mission and goals.  This will strengthen the SJWG’s position as an advocate for water quality protection and improvement and increase membership and participation within the group.

Objectives
The SJWG proposes an E. coli pollutant load reduction goal of 1.87 x 1010 cfu/day.  The goal was developed from the Stevens Arroyo Monitoring Report (2006) and the companion Stevens Arroyo Baseline Report (2007).  (Both reports are on the enclosed cd and the monitoring report is available online at the NMED/SWQB website at http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/swqb/wps/San_Juan/StevensArroyoMonitoringReport-2006.pdf.)  E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo is extremely variable during the year.  In 2007 the average E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo was 3.00 x 1011 cfu/day.  The SJWG estimates 25% of that loading (7.5 x 1010 E. coli cfu/day) is attributable to the practices of livestock grazing and penning along the Stevens Arroyo and livestock grazing of flood irrigated pastures.  The SJWG goal is to reduce the above loading by 25%. 

...

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local property owners/managers willing to implement appropriate BMPs.  Priority will be given to those areas identified in the Source ID Final Report as significant sources of bacterial and nutrient loading.  Property ownership will be determined through the San Juan County Assessor’s Office and other appropriate sources.  Owner identification and contact information is available from that office.  

Methods
Based on land use and activity, the pollutant load reductions will be achieved by implementing appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs) using two approaches.   The first approach is to work cooperatively with the United Stated Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to implement BMPs with local agricultural producers.  The NRCS administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) which provides cost-share funds to working farms and ranches for conservation improvements.  One of the program’s national priorities is the “reduction of non-point source pollution, such as nutrients, sediment, pesticides, or excess salinity in impaired watersheds, consistent with Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) where available, as well as reduction of groundwater contamination and conservation of ground and surface water resources”.  

The project’s goal will be the implementation of agricultural BMPs on irrigated bottomland located in the valley areas of the watershed adjacent to or in relatively close proximity to the rivers and perennial streams.  The SJWG estimates that this represents approximately 25% of the 29,000 total acres of irrigated lands in the watershed, exclusive of the Navajo Agricultural Products Incorporated (NAPI) lands.  BMPs for these properties include:
•	Manure management
•	Riparian access management for livestock
•	Soil conservation BMPs
•	Conversion to efficient irrigation systems
•	Fertilizer management
•	Vegetated buffers.

The project includes the following activities to accomplish the BMPs. Voluntary implementation of grazing BMPs in the riparian area.  The most effective practices are complete exclusion of livestock from the riparian areas, or the creation of riparian pastures accompanied by careful management of the grazing resource, and provision of off-channel water sources.  

Voluntary implementation of BMPs to increase irrigation efficiencies (30% efficiency for flood irrigation), including irrigation scheduling (to avoid over-application of water – 35 to 40% efficiency), installation of gated irrigation pipe (50% efficiency), installation if sprinkler irrigation (80% efficiency), drip irrigation (95% efficiency) and to decrease irrigation return flows, including land leveling (to permit even watering with less return flow) and tailwater detention (to slow the return of overflow to the stream).  

The BMPs for flood irrigation will reduce bacterial and nutrient loading to the Animas, La Plata and San Juan River by increasing irrigation efficiencies, reducing water usage and reducing irrigation return flows.  Lower, or no, return flows from irrigated pasture and agricultural fields will reduce the quantity of bacteria and nutrients delivered to the receiving stream.  Livestock holding BMPs will remove the livestock from the stream banks and the revegetation of riparian areas will reduce the amount of manure and other animal wastes directly entering the stream and/or river. 

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local agricultural producers willing to seek EQIP funding.  EQIP funding is awarded competitively, but the ranking formula awards additional points for projects that benefit a CWA Section 319 funded project.  For the past three years the local work group, which advises the Aztec NRCS office on how to apply the Farm Bill and EQIP funding, has supported awarding additional points above those in the standard ranking formula to those projects identified by the SJWG which result in BMPs that improve water quality in the watershed.  Although total Farm Bill and EQIP funding varies from year to year, a minimum of $30,000 to $40,000 annually is expected to be available for EQIP projects during the term of this proposal.  Currently there are four agricultural producers participating in the EQIP/Section 319 partnership in the SJWG’s current Phase II project.       

For those agricultural producers interested in participating in water quality improvements, the EQIP program typically funds 50% or more of the agricultural producer’s costs.  EQIP funds are determined by NRCS from available price lists to establish maximum reimbursable rates for a wide variety of BMP related activities, such as fencing and irrigation equipment.  The 2010 payment schedule is 75% to 90% of EQIP costlist.  The 2010 payment schedule is available at http://www.nm.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/fotg/section-1/cost-data/2010/2010-costdockets.html.  During the current Phase II project, EQIP funding has varied from 60% to 80% of the project’s total cost.  The CWA Section 319 monies will be used to fund 60% of the producer’s EQIP cost share.

NRCS staff provides technical and design assistance for proposed EQIP projects.  Agricultural producers contract with NRCS to maintain the BMPs and related equipment in proper operating condition for 7 years following installation.  

Permits, certifications and clearances are not anticipated for these projects.  Any work in the riparian area should be conducted in conformance with the United States Army Corps of Engineer’s (ACE) existing nationwide 404 permit.

The second approach will be to identify willing private land owners and/or public entities, such as local and county governments and state and federal land management agencies, not eligible for EQIP to implement appropriate BMPs.  

CWA Section 319 funding will be used for property owners who are not agricultural producers but engaged in agricultural activity to implement the same BMPs identified above. (EQIP funding is only available to individuals who are engaged in agriculture for income.  Non-producers are individuals who do not derive income from their agricultural activities.  These include hobby farmers and individuals who have horses and other livestock for pleasure or personal consumption.)  Funding will also be used for private and public property owners/managers to implement stormwater management, stream channel and steam bed improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration BMPs.  The following stormwater related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Pervious surface installation in the urban environment in favor of impervious surfaces
•	Infiltration swales
•	Detention ponds/constructed wetlands
•	Stabilization and re-vegetation of erosional features and disturbed lands
•	Properly graded, constructed, drained gas field roads and other native surfaced roads.
•	Sand filters to intercept and treat piped municipal stormwater discharges

The following stream channel/bed improvement and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Removal of inappropriate riprap (car bodies, scrap metal, scrap concrete, etc.)
•	Bank stabilization
•	Re-channelization to improve sinuosity and hydrology
•	Creation/expansion of flood plain areas for sediment capture and vegetation recruitment
•	Wetlands restoration

For agricultural BMPs, NRCS can provide design and engineering assistance for property owners who are not agricultural producers.  The NRCS price list will be used as the basis for cost determination for applicable BMP design.  Stormwater management BMPs, stream channel/bed improvements and wetlands/riparian habitat restoration will be designed by appropriate engineers.  Clearances and certifications (archeological, cultural and historical) and permits for stream channel work from the Army Corps of Engineers and NMED will be obtained by the engineer or the property owner/manager.     

Bacteria and nutrient load reductions for agricultural BMPs were discussed above.  Stormwater related BMPs would provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by reducing the discharge of manure and other fecal wastes, fertilizer and sediment to the rivers from storm events.  Stream channel improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration will provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by restoring the natural function of the habitat, increasing assimilative capacity and reducing stream bank erosion.

...

A variety of indicators to measure success will be used depending on the type and location of the BMP implemented.  Water sampling for E. coli bacteria and/or nutrients may be used when agricultural BMPs are implemented within a sub-watershed with a perennial stream.  This type of measurement is consistent with the monitoring of the Stevens Arroyo and Shumway Arroyo watersheds being conducted under the Phase II project.  Water quality sampling will be for bacteria along the La Plata and San Juan Rivers and nutrients along the Animas River.  All projects will begin by establishing a relevant baseline(s) from historical sampling events, if available, and/or sampling events prior to implementing a BMP.  A post monitoring plan will determine a reduction in bacterial or nutrient loading.  

Appropriate pollutant load reduction models will be used for agricultural BMPs located in areas without perennial streams.  One such model is STEPL, which is a simplified spreadsheet tool for estimating the load reductions that result from implementing BMPs.  STEPL includes a management practice calculator that computes the combined effectiveness of multiple practices implemented in serial or parallel configurations (or both) in a watershed.  This model is preferred because users of the model are not required to have any specialized programming skills.  STEPL will be used for BMPs implemented in the Animas River watershed to model nutrient and sediment load reductions.

Currently there are no acceptable methods to model fecal and E. coli bacterial load reductions from BMP implementation.  Where possible, a sampling plan that includes the collection and analysis of water samples for E. coli bacteria will be developed to document pre- and post-BMP bacteria levels.  A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) will be developed and submitted for approval.  Sampling will conform to the QAPP approved as part of this project.    

Vegetative changes and recovery will be used to monitor the effectiveness of wetlands and riparian habitat restoration projects.  Visual and photographic documentation will be used for monitoring stream channel improvements.

The goal of the Pocasse/Campbell Watershed Implementation Project is to restore and protect the water quality of Spring Creek, Lake Campbell, and Lake Pocasse through the installation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the watershed that target sources of sediment, nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria.  This project is the initial step towards reducing non-point source (NPS) pollution to Lake Pocasse, to achieve full support status of all the Lake’s beneficial uses.  This project segment will target BMP installation in the Spring Creek watershed and develop a long term Project Implementation Plan for the watershed.   

This proposed project is the first segment of a locally planned multi-year effort to implement best management practices (BMPs) in the Spring Creek Watershed (which includes Lake Campbell and Lake Pocasse) that will restore water quality to meet designated beneficial uses and water quality standards.  BMPs in this project segment are targeted to the Spring Creek Watershed based on impairment information identified in the Lake Campbell/Pocasse Watershed Assessment, completed in December 2008. During the next year and a half, project staff will initiate implementation BMPs in the Spring Creek Watershed and develop a long-term project implementation plan (PIP) to address the TMDLs established for water bodies within the watershed. Future segments of this project will implement BMPs in the watershed to reduce nutrient, sediment, and Fecal Coliform Bacteria loading from agricultural runoff to Spring Creek, Lake Campbell, and Lake Pocasse. Public education and information will also be provided in future segments of the implementation project. Conservation practices that are planned for implementation include installation of animal waste management systems, alternative water sources for livestock, planned grazing systems, riparian buffers, and an information and education program.

The South Fork of the Trinity River is included on California's Clean Water Act, Section 303(d) as water quality impaired due to sediment. The South Fork Trinity River basin consists of approximately 932 square miles of primarily mountainous forested lands. Elevations in the basin range from more than 7,800 feet above sea level in the headwater areas of the North Yolla Bolly Mountains, to less than 400 feet at the confluence with the Trinity River. The South Fork originates in the North Yolla Bolly Mountains about 50 miles southwest of Redding, and runs northwest for approximately 90 miles before reaching its confluence with the Trinity River near Salyer. The South Fork Trinity River is the largest undammed river in California. The 56 mile stretch from Forest Glen to the mouth is protected by the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  In an ongoing effort to meet TMDL indicator targets, this project will continue with the implementation of sediment reduction projects, primarily road decommissioning and road upgrades (storm-proofing) as recommended by road inventories, watershed analysis, and environmental assessments.

Objectives
There are three primary goals for the project. Goal 1 is to improve watershed conditions for beneficial uses and to meet TMDL targets. The objective is to implement projects that reduce sediment delivery through road decommission and upgrade to achieve sediment savings. The outcome is meeting TMDL targets, improvement to beneficial uses, including restored anadromous fisheries. Goal 2 is to identify, select and refine restoration measures and management practices that will best contribute to TMDL implementation options. The objective is to monitor project effectiveness. The outcome of this project is achieving TMDL targets particularly on federal lands, which makes up over 90% of the watershed and to foster adaptive management for overall watershed health. Goal 3 of this project is to transfer information about the results of the restoration practices to other watersheds to increase cost effectiveness and facilitate TMDL implementation projects throughout the state.

Methods
This project will be implemented on public lands managed by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. This project will decommission 11.4 miles of road and upgrade 16.7 miles of road in the East Fork/Sims and Hidden Valley Hydrologic Units on Forest Service lands for a total sediment savings of 38,460 cubic yards. This project is ready to implement as NEPA has been completed, specifications and operating procedures are in place.

The Klamath Tracking and Accounting Program (Klamath TAP) defines a consistent accounting system that links conservation projects to load reductions called for in both California's and Oregon's Klamath River TMDLs. The Klamath TAP goal is to increase the pace and reduce the cost of improving Klamath Basin water quality to support all beneficial uses, including recovery of native fish. This project will: 1) integrate conservation priorities from multiple federal, state and private conservation initiatives interested in the Klamath river basin, 2) tailor tools to the specific needs of the Klamath basin and expand their applicability to additional conservation practices, 3) demonstrate the use of draft protocol and expanded tools by selecting, implementing and quantifying the benefits from multiple conservation projects, and 4) launch the full program by engaging program participants through training and outreach, and formally establishing the management system defined in the draft protocol. 

Objectives
The expansion of Klamath TAP described here will address impairments to Klamath main stem and tributaries including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. Also, this project will fulfill a task identified in both California’s and Oregon’s Klamath River TMDLs: to develop and implement a basinwide water quality tracking and accounting program that would establish a framework to track water quality improvements, facilitate planning and coordinated TMDL implementation, and enable appropriate water quality offsets or trades.

Methods
Klamath TAP will occur in several steps: 
1) Site selection and eligibility. 
2) Quantification of baseline condition and post-project condition for temperature and nutrient loads.
3) Verification of reductions.
4) Calibration of load quantification tools.
5) Reporting of project data in a central database.
6) Adaptive management of both quantification tools and Klamath TAP program structure.","N","Project Implementation","18010212","180102120401","N","04/01/2013","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:82528"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,123100

Red Rock Creek is a 26,482 acre watershed, flowing into Cottonwood Creek at stream mile 7.0; which then flows into the South Fork of the Clearwater River. There are currently 16 separate worksites. Work will be with livestock feeding areas.

Objectives:
 Red Rock Creek was identified as needing a 64% reduction in sediment; 50% reduction in temperature (75% shade increase); 89% dissolved oxygen reduction; 93% phosphorus reduction and a 67% pathogen reduction. This project will implement practices that are consistent with the implementation plans and provide needed water quality benefits.

Methods:
Expected outcomes are implementing Livestock BMP practices on up to 16 worksites in Red Rock Creek watershed that will reduce or eliminate livestock access to streams, reduce sediment and pathogens transport to streams, provide off-stream watering, reduce roof runoff through lots, develop springs and watering options and to reduce overland flow through lots. These improvements will reduce the sediment, nutrients and pathogens directly. In time, temperature will be reduced through added shade; and the dissolved oxygen will be changed.

The Clean Water Act has charged each States’ NPS agency with two primary tasks:  1.  Identify all waters being impacted by NPS pollution, and 2.  Develop a management program describing NPS pollution programs to be implemented to correct any identified problems.  In addition, each State’s NPS agency is charged with an identification of all programs, including enforcement, to achieve implementation, cooperation with local, regional and interstate entities which are actively planning for NPS controls, and to report on program status of addressing NPS impacts and improving water quality.

Given such monumental tasks, the OCC will initiate a new monitoring program, coordinated with other monitoring programs in the state, to address NPS issues in the State.  Assessment of the State’s water quality is the foundation for meeting the long-term goals for the State NPS program.  To fully address NPS pollution, a dynamic monitoring program comprised of four stages has been described in the 1999 revised NPS management plan.  The first stage includes a comprehensive, coordinated investigation and analysis of the causes and sources of NPS pollution throughout the State—Ambient Monitoring.  The second stage involves more intensive, specialized monitoring designed to identify specific causes and sources of NPS pollution—Diagnostic Monitoring.  The data from diagnostic monitoring can be used to formulate an implementation plan to specifically address the sources and types of NPS pollution identified in diagnostic monitoring.  The third stage of monitoring, conducted during the execution of this implementation plan, is designed to perform or undertake remedial and/or mitigation efforts to address the NPS problems—Implementation Monitoring.  Finally, the forth stage evaluates the effectiveness of the implementation through assessment and post-implementation monitoring—Success Monitoring.   This work plan is to implement the first  and second phases of monitoring.  The past four fiscal years have been devoted to monitoring data gaps across the state beginning with the east half of the state and subsequently rotating to the south west and north west parts of the state.  The data gaps projects were designed to achieve comprehensive coverage of each ecoregion of the state.  The data gaps projects filled in incomplete monitoring coverage resulting from early 319 guidance allowing project specific monitoring only.  The work program takes evolution of NPS monitoring to the next stage by initiating routine comprehensive monitoring of smaller watersheds for NPS impacts.


Objectives
The OCC will survey streams in the Neosho and Upper Canadian basins. The objectives of this assessment is to identify NPS threatened and impaired waterbodies and to verify non impairment to give an accurate assessment of Oklahoma’s water quality as affected by NPS. The second objective of this assessment is to gather needed data to more intensively assess streams where impairment is identified to verify the causes of impairment, identify categorical and geographical sources  and to gather other data needed to allow planning restoration strategies.  A final objective is to check water bodies previously identified as affected by NPS pollution to determine if threats or impairment continue.

An important element of a successful Stormwater Program is to enhance public awareness and understanding of Stormwater Pollution Prevention issues which includes non-point source contamination.  This is accomplished through a dedicated education plan.  Our grant project is to develop a stormwater pollution prevention education program for Peoria students in grades K -8.  The education program will be titled “Stormwater Pollution Prevention in Your Neighborhood.”  The focus of the program is a hands-on, interactive stormwater model that allows the students to see the effects of non-point contaminants. The goal of the program is to educate the students on stormwater pollution prevention issues and identify positive behaviors that will enhance our environment on a long term basis.

The primary target for the project is school-age children, but it is anticipated that this message will be carried on from the children to our secondary target – the children’s families, via discussion and inspiring literature that the children will take home from the program. The success of this delivery method has been proven through other environmental education programs such as water conservation and recycling. 


Objectives
The goal of the program is to educate the students on stormwater pollution prevention issues and identify positive behaviors that will enhance our environment on a long term basis.

Methods

Two stormwater pollution prevention hands-on/interactive presentations will be developed; one for children in grades K-3 and another for grades 4-8. The presentation will be tailored to the cognitive development of each age group.     

The Stormwater Team will offer this education program to local public and charter schools.  The Stormwater School Program will also be presented at the City of Peoria Recreation Department’s before and after school program and summer recreation programs that are heavily attended by Peoria’s school age children.  Class sizes typically range from fifteen to fifty participants in each group.  The Stormwater Team anticipates conducting approximately twenty six presentations per year; therefore the anticipated audience may be up to 1,000 participants or more in one year! 

The Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program will also be promoted on our City’s website, at city sponsored events and through our Communication and Public Affairs Department.  This would be the first time the City has launched an education program dedicated solely to Stormwater Pollution Prevention. 

The “Stormwater Pollution Prevention In Your Neighborhood” Program will include the following four components.

A.  Discussion about stormwater pollution prevention:  An introduction about stormwater issues, how it affects us in Peoria and what we can do to protect our City and natural resources. This will include visual aids such as PowerPoint or poster board pictures of various sources of stormwater pollution and of the rivers, streams and lakes in Peoria that may be impacted by pollution and pollution prevention.

B.  City stormwater model:   A hands-on, interactive stormwater model will be the feature attraction of our presentation. We will use a reusable city-scape (Stormwater Model Description is listed below) staged with non-point pollution sources that the children have seen in their neighborhoods.  Examples such as car washing, pool draining, vehicles leaking and uncollected pet wastes will be visible in the model. The children will be invited to gather around the model, and point out the potential pollutants on the “city streets.”  The students will be able to identify pollutants such as a car leaking oil, a dog doing his “business” and a homeowner washing a car in the driveway.   Other items may also be added or modified at times.  The children will then use a watering can to simulate rain by sprinkling water over the scene from a plastic watering can.  The “rain” will liquefy the gels and cause “contaminated” water to run from the street to the storm drain. The spilled oil (black food coloring gel), the pet waste (brown food coloring gel) and the car wash waste (red, blue, yellow and green food coloring gel) will be washed down to level 2, via the depicted storm drains in the display, and finally to level 3, a body of clean Peoria water with miniature aquatic life represented.  This entire process will be viewed by the children through the clear acrylic layers that will comprise the model. 

City-Scape Stormwater Model Description:
The city-scape demonstration model will be constructed by stacking three acrylic boxes into one cut-out view of a neighborhood, its subterranean network of storm drains and finally, the waters that the drains spill into.  

All labor including art work, construction, assembly, administration and presentation of the lesson will be performed by City personnel and/or by utilizing voluntary services to the fullest extent possible.

Project Background/Justification:  With the reauthorization amendments in 1990 of the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, states with approved coastal management programs were required to develop a corollary comprehensive program to address coastal nonpoint source pollution.  DNR’s Environmental Protection Division (EPD) in conjunction with the Coastal Resources Division (CRD) has been working on the development of a Coastal Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program since 1999.  Georgia’s proposed program was reviewed by EPA and NOAA and received conditional approval in 2002. To receive final approval of Georgia’s Coastal NPS Program, the State must address the identified program deficiencies.  Final approval of Georgia’s program is required for the State to continue receiving full funding under both the Coastal Zone Management Act and the Clean Water Act 319(h) nonpoint source program.  

The Coastal NPS Program is designed to implement a wide variety of management measures to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution from impacting the critical coastal environment. With the exception of the metropolitan Atlanta area, the coast is the most rapidly growing area in the State of Georgia and growth is predicted to continue and to accelerate in the near future. With this growth comes added stress on the fragile coastal ecosystems critical to seafood and tourism industries and the quality of life. Unlike many coastal states, Georgia is in a unique position in that an effective nonpoint source program can be established prior to the extensive development impacts that are sure to come. Obtaining final approval of the Coastal NPS Program is the first step in establishing that program. Full approval is necessary to preserve full federal funding levels for both the Coastal Management Program and the statewide 319 Nonpoint Source Program.

The EPA and NOAA agency review of Georgia’s Coastal Nonpoint Source Program identified key opportunities to address program deficiencies through the improved use of Section 401 Water Quality Certification for coastal area projects.   This project will continue to fund a position to conduct 401 reviews in Georgia’s coastal nonpoint management area. Housed in the Coastal District Offices of the EPD, this position will coordinate closely through the statewide 401-certification staff, Coastal and Statewide Nonpoint Program staff, Coastal Resources Division and other natural resource agencies and programs to thoroughly review projects.

Local governments, with oversight by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD) and the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC), are primarily responsible for implementing the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act (Act).  To help strengthen current enforcement activities in Coastal Georgia, Camden County will employ one (1) Erosion and Sediment Control Inspector to continue and strengthen current enforcement activities through ensuring compliance with Camden County’s Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance. 

Objectives
The objective of this project is to improve the water quality within Camden County by:

·	Strengthening enforcement of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act and Erosion and Sedimentation Act in Camden County by employing one full-time Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Inspector to monitor and enforce the County’s Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance.
·	Improving the implementation rate, quality of installation and maintenance of Erosion and Sediment Control Best Management Practices on construction sites.
·	Enhancing the overall inspection process and coordination among the agencies with ESC responsibilities consistent with the roles under current law for each agency.
·	Improving Erosion and Sediment Control Plans and the quality of Plan reviews.
·	Assisting the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC) and Coastal construction community in meeting their legal responsibilities under House Bill 285, which requires that all parties involved with land-disturbing activities be trained and certified by the Commission. This mandated training will help increase ESC compliance by maximizing participants’ understanding of ESC principles and Best Management Practices (BMPs).
·	Provide assistance in meeting the requirements of the Executive Order by Governor Perdue for the Georgia Coastal Comprehensive Plan (including stormwater management and wellhead protection).
·	Educating the public and contractors regarding Camden County policies and procedures on erosion and sedimentation control.
·	Assist the general public and contractors with implementation of proper BMP installation and maintenance in the field.
·	Development of a Greenspace Plan for Camden County through implementation of Smart/Quality Growth.

The latest EPA / NOAA Findings and Approvals states that in the Urban – New Development section “The Georgia program does not include management measures in conformity with the 6217 (g) guidance. The state does not include management measures to reduce total suspended solids by 80% after the construction site is permanently stabilized, or to maintain post-development peak runoff rates at pre-development levels in conformity with 6217 guidance.” Improving Erosion and Sediment Control planning, implementation, inspection, training certification, and enforcement will help Georgia achieve this target level of reduced total suspended solids from new developments in the coastal region.  

As Coastal Georgia experiences unprecedented pressure from growth and development, strategies are needed to protect the world-class natural resources that enrich and inspire our lives and that draw us to visit and live on the Georgia coast. According to the University of Georgia’s Website www.georgiastats.uga.edu , Bryan County’s population grew 69% between 1990 and 2004. Effingham’s population grew 65%, Long’s 72%, Camden’s 48%, and McIntosh’s 28% during the same period.  This trend is not only expected to continue, but to accelerate as inland populations migrate to the Coast.  

Local governments, with oversight by the GAEPD and the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC), are primarily responsible for enforcing the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act (Act) and the NPDES General Permits for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity.  The Act directs local governments to enact erosion and sedimentation control ordinances.  These ordinances are reviewed by the GAEPD and, if consistent with State law, the local government is certified as a Local Issuing Authority.  Approximately 325 municipalities and counties have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities.  Where local ordinances have not been adopted, the GAEPD is responsible for inspection and enforcement of the Act and the NPDES General Permits.  Local and state agencies currently do not have the resources necessary to adequately enforce these regulations.  

To help strengthen current enforcement activities in Coastal Georgia, the Coastal Georgia RC&D Council will employ two (2) Erosion and Sediment Control Inspectors to work with Local Issuing Authorities in eight (8) Coastal Georgia counties: Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, Liberty, Long, and McIntosh. One will cover the northern coastal counties and be stationed in the Council’s office building in Richmond Hill, Bryan County. The second Inspector will cover the south coast and be stationed in the NRCS office in Brunswick, Glynn County.

Objectives
The objective of this project is to improve the water quality within the eight Coastal counties by:
·	Strengthening enforcement of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, the NPDES General Permits for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity, and the Erosion and Sedimentation Act in the Coastal region by hiring two personnel to conduct detailed ESC Plan reviews and site inspections.
·	Improving Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Plans and the quality of plan reviews.
·	Improving the effectiveness of Local Issuing Authority (LIA) enforcement staff by instituting a program of comprehensive site inspections for ESC compliance, and reporting evidence of noncompliance to local and state enforcement authorities.
·	Improving the implementation rate, quality of installation and maintenance of Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Best Management Practices on construction sites.
·	Enhancing the overall plan review and inspection process and coordination among the agencies with ESC responsibilities consistent with the roles under current law for each agency.
·	Assisting the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission and Coastal construction community in meeting their legal responsibilities under the new House Bill 285 requirement that all parties involved with land-disturbing activities be trained and certified by the Commission. This mandated training will help increase ESC compliance by maximizing participants’ understanding of ESC principles and Best Management Practices (BMPs). 
·	 Serving as a potential regional model for future 319(h) funding of Regional ESC Inspectors, which have previously only been funded at the County level in Georgia.


Methods
The two (2) ESC Inspectors hired will have the following responsibilities:
·	Inspect permitted construction sites with approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans to verify that the Best Management Practices (BMPs) planned are being installed and maintained properly.  
·	Perform NPDES NOT (Notice of Termination) inspections as assigned by GAEPD Coastal District personnel.  
·	Complete ESC Plan reviews using the new expanded GSWCC checklist as plans become available.
·	Provide a written project assessment comprised of two summary reports documenting 20 representative site inspections each.  
·	Form and meet regularly with Project Oversight Committee consisting of representatives from state and local agencies with ESC enforcement responsibilities.  
·	Respond to complaints of ESC violations filed by private citizens or forwarded for investigation by LIAs and document actions taken. 
·	Train Local Issuing Authority staff to improve their ability to provide effective oversight.  
·	Help perform assessments of local ESC programs. Assessments will be conducted using the GSWCC’s standard “Overview Criteria” checklist, and the responses of local authorities to the questions on that checklist will constitute the basis of the assessment report.  Assessments will be scheduled and directed by GSWCC personnel.  
·	Organize and help deliver regional ESC Re-certification Workshops and tests under the supervision of the GSWCC.  
·	Prepare a project report at the end of the first 2 years summarizing project successes to date.
·	Disseminate hard copies of GSWCC publications to the construction community and local government staff for use as references.  Distribute ESC Field Manuals onsite and at regional ESC certification workshops.  Note: These resources will be distributed as GSWCC makes them available.  
·	Document inspector’s activities with monthly progress reports.

"50","items",NA,"GA",64480,"OSDS Phase II","$325,000","Overview
Most of GA's coastal counties have limited public sewage treatment systems and rely on individual septic tank systems, known as Onsite Disposal Systems (OSDS), to handle human sewage production. Coastal development trends are causing increased installation of OSDS. Rapid increases in the number of septic tank systems can seriously affect the health of the caostal environment, as well as human health. The high water table and sandy soils in many areas of coastal GA are minimally suitable for OSDS installation. Local public health systems often lack the resources to conduct proper soil surveys in certain portions of the counties and improper systems are sometimes installed. In particularly rural or remote portions of the counties, many OSDS were installed before regulations were enacted and/or perhaps were installed in violation of regulated standards. Thus, most local governmnetal units have neither kept records of the number of OSDS in their jurisdictions nor their location. Current system installations are generally recorded in paper files and most do not have geo-referenced information.

Nonpoint source pollutions generally, and OSDS in particular, poses a major threat to water quality along the GA coast. Major sources of NPS can include storm drain runoff, wildlife, runoff of pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides from agricultural lands, residential lawns and golf courses, as well as fecal contamination from faulty OSDS. Fecal contimination of GA""s coastal waters is increasing. Of GA's 20 estuarine areas, 19 are cloased to shellfish harvesting (GDNR 1998). Ten of these areas are closed due to fecal contimination from NPS. Impacts of fecal contimination can force the closure of shellfish growing areas, curtailing oyster and clam harvesting and lead to the closure of clam farms and beachs designated for public swimming.

This project will continue efforts from the OSDS Phase I that have already built upon other Section 319(h) projects. More than 15 organizations and local governmental units will be participating partners in this effort. The project comes at an opportune time in the implementation of two major initiatives that address OSDS and wastewater, the Statewide Water Plan (and Councils) and the Coastal Comprehensive Plan.

Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:  1) prevent OSDS contimination of marshlands and surface waters through enhanced enforcement and compliance with public health rules and regulations and 2) produce and present a GIS project capable of identifying state waters most susceptible to impairment from NPS due to OSDS.

Methods
1) Train employees from county health offices to locate and provide GPS data on OSDS and private wells

2) Obtain through offical local records, addresses for residential and business properties located a pre-determined distance from marshlands or other waters

3) A minimum of 4 meetings between county healh department officials, MAREX and County Board of Commissioners to explain the goals of the project

4) Conduct a survey of OSDS and well locations within a 90' proximity to marshlands or other state waters in Camden, Chatham, Glynn and McIntosh counties

5) Transfer collected information to WELSTROM database

6) Compel OSDS enforcement and compliance by inspecting the condition of all systems with 90' to the surface waters

7) Cretate GIS maps and analyses of OSDS and wells

8) Produce pollution susceptibility profile/index of coastal waters developed through a workgroup process representing scientists, policy makers, coastal resource managers, local field staff and GIS professionals
 
9) Present the findings of the survey and the OSDS susceptibility index to local governments and local health departments

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Otter Creek Watershed is located in Piute County. Utah between longitude -112° 5' 34"" on the west and -111° 41'49"" on the east and between latitude 38° 42'29"" on the north and latitude 38° 7' 42"" on the south.  The watershed encompasses 240,000 acres (375 sq mi) of rangeland, forest, irrigated pasture, irrigated cropland, meadow pasture, and small urban areas. The watershed is about 39 miles long and 12 miles wide. Otter Creek is a tributary to the East Fork of the Sevier River, running the length of Grass Valley from north to south into Otter Creek Reservoir. Otter Creek drains the east slope of Parker Mountain and the west slope of Monroe Mountain. Planned project activities include the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) on private and public lands to reduce sediment, nutrients and coliform, and to improve fish and wildlife habitat. Planned BMPs are those directed toward increased vegetative cover along Otter Creek, range improvement, irrigation water management, grazing management, stream stabilization, stream bank protection, improved riparian areas and improvement of public recreation facilities.


Objectives
SUMMARIZATION OF MAJOR GOALS: Goal # 1 - Reduce NFS water pollutants that are affecting the quality of water in Otter Creek and Otter Creek Reservoir to the extent that water quality will meet Utah's standards for Class 2B, 3A and 4 waters and to achieve the stream and reservoir's potential as a trout fishery. Goal # 2 - Document the use of 319 funds and evaluate program effectiveness.

Methods
2.0 PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND TECHNICAL METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION
2.1 Overall goal and objectives
Goals listed below are based on implementing the complete HUA Plan independent of funding source.  Unless otherwise noted, objectives, tasks, products and costs are for completion of the project. Funding obtained through EPA's 319 Water Quality Program will be used to implement portions of this HUA Project Plan and are identified in the budget tables by year

GOAL # 1: Reduce NPS water pollutants to the extent that the quality of water in Otter Creek Watershed will meet Utah's water quality standards for Class 3A and Class 4 waters and to achieve the potential of Otter Creek and Otter Creek Reservoir as a trout fishery.

OBJECTIVE 1: Reduce the sediment, nutrient and coliform loading coming from rangeland to acceptable, non-impairing levels.  Refer to the Budget Tables for costs and quantities by practice to be implemented with each task listed below.

TASK 1.     NRCS will assist cooperators in developing 32 Resource Management System plans (RMSs) and in implementing them using applicable Best Management Practices (BMPs).  BLM and USFS will assist in developing plans that include Public or National Forest lands.

Product:     Thirty two (32) Resource Management Plans developed and implemented.
Cost:        $112,000.

TASK 2.     NRCS will assist cooperators to implement fertilizer management, pasture and hayland planting, pasture and hayland management, irrigation water management, fencing, livestock water development, and pest and nutrient management on 5950 acres of privately owned irrigated and meadow pasture. .These practices are designed to decrease sediment and nutrient loading to non-impairing levels and coliform to 500 colonies per 100 ml from these sources.

FY 2002 funds will be used to reduce pollution from animal feeding operations(AFOs) designated as potential CAFOs by the statewide AFO inventory. Pollution will be reduced through the implementation of manure management BMPs at a dairy located on Otter Creek.  Cost: $24,000

Product:     BMPs implemented on 5950 acres of pasture and hayland; Reduction of coliform,nutrients, and sediment.
Cost:        $322,500

TASK 3.     NRCS, BLM, USFS, will coordinate assistance to cooperator/permittee to implement BMP's that will result in an increase of vegetative cover on 25,000 acres of critically eroding rangeland (federal and nonfederal.) These BMPs will primarily include Brush Management (mechanical and chemical). Range Seeding, Critical Area Planting, Proper Grazing Use, Planned Grazing Systems, Deferred Grazing, Pipeline, Trough or Tank and Fencing. These practices are designed to reduce the sediment yield by 45,000 tons per year.

When/if pesticides are planned for use on federal lands the responsible federal land management agency will prepare a resource management plan and the necessary NEPA documentation.  Herbicide spraying for sagebrush control and weed control is a current authorized practice and poses no long term threat to the environment since all brush control practices are subject to NRCS Technical Guide specifications, EPA approved label directions, FIFRA guidelines, USU Extension Service guidelines and recommendations, and The Utah Department of Agriculture spray applicators licensing requirements. Spray material will be applied by applicators who hold a current spray applicators license from the Utah Department of Agriculture.

If chaining is selected as the most feasible method to control juniper invasions, adequate documentation for support, need and effectiveness will be submitted to EPA for approval before using 319 funds.

When available, the most recent computer model programs will be used to help access ground water conditions and needs. Careful evaluation and effort will be given to ensure that all species listed on state and federal endangered species lists, that are present in the project treatment area, will be protected.

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) treated Otter Creek with rotenone, in 1994, to control whirling disease of fish. Otter Creek was then restocked with brown trout, rainbow trout and cutthroat trout and will be maintained as a wild fishery.

Product:     Improved fishery habitat along 20 miles of stream and increased production of fish (200 pounds of fish per acre).
Cost:        $20,000

TASK 10.    DWR will implement their Management Plans for Big Game Control. This action will reduce conflicts with winter livestock grazing areas. The Big Game Management Plan for Elk and deer in this region has been completed and is now being implemented. Currently, special hunts are being used to control deer populations to reduce the impacts on private cropland and pasture land in the valley bottom. Current deer population is estimated at 3000 head, down from 5000 head a few years ago. Extreme weather conditions in past years have accounted for much of the deer loss. The elk population is listed at 300 head by DWR.

The Fremont River Watershed is currently addressing water quality problems identified within the Fremont River Water Quality Management Plan (2002) including excess nutrients in the upper portion and salt loading in the lower. Producers are increasingly aware of the need to totally contain animal wastes and reduce runoff but are reluctant to implement costly solutions. Successful projects combine a voluntary approach with cost-share assistance to identify key system components that properly contain manure while allowing management flexibility. In addition, assistance is needed in helping producers to develop proper application and utilization methods for applying both liquid and solid manure as well as reducing runoff from irrigated lands. We anticipate receiving cost share funding this year (2005) from USDA’s EQIP program as well as some funding from the Utah Legislature. These projects will showcase proper storage and application ideas that if implemented area-wide, will improve water quality to down-stream users. Best Management Practices may include: Waste Storage Structures; Waste utilization; Nutrient and Pest Management; Composting; Prescribed Grazing; Streambank Stabilization. Projects will include total containment of manure along with proper application and utilization. Tours and Fact sheets will be developed highlighting project accomplishments.

The Town of Hancock is proposing the replacement of the existing drainage system along Main Street with a contemporary system of leaching catch basins and leaching fields.  Hancock's Main Street encompasses approximately 4000 feet of state-maintained roadway as well as several parking areas in the commercial district, including the post office, church, town offices, and parking facilities for the beach at Norway Pond. 

Objectives
The drainage system in use is outdated and currently deposits the entire storm water runoff, which includes nonpoint source pollution, into either Norway Pond or Davis Brook. The primary goal of this project is to eliminate the nonpoint source pollution from entering the named water bodies.  The soil beneath Main Street is comprised of coarse sand that will make the proposed leaching systems effective cleansing agents for the contaminants that are currently entering the system.

Introduction: This project will utilize Section 319(h) NPS funding to support an Orphaned Lands NPS Coordinator (OL-NPS Coordinator) position in the Division of Mineral Mining's Special Projects Management Section. The Coordinator will inventory mineral mine sites in selected priority watersheds in Virginia as noted below. The information gathered will be evaluated for integration into the Division of Soil and Water Conservation's (DSWC) GIS system. The OL-NPS Coordinator will act as contact between DSWC and DMME for NPS related data and information. This position will be responsible for conducting site investigations using the protocol developed during the first year of funding, planning restoration of mine sites in priority watersheds, and contracting for, and inspecting, site reclamation efforts.

Objectives
Description: The OL-NPS Coordinator will support the objectives of Virginia's Nonpoint Source Management Plan, in the area of Resource Extraction, by: a.) Completing inventory and prioritization of orphaned mine sites for reclamation, b.) Working to abate sources of NPS pollution from prior resource extraction activities in Virginia. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation's GIS database will support this effort, increasing the effectiveness of Virginia's nonpoint source pollution abatement program.

Specifically, this project would increase identification of mining-related sources of NPS pollution. The continuation of this project will help ascertain if a detailed system of assessment, targeting, and prioritization, coupled with selective reclamation of sites and watersheds, is productive in increasing the effectiveness of Virginia's Nonpoint Source Pollution Abatement Program

Methods
Measurable Environmental Results:  The continued support of the NPS Program for mineral mines will result in the following types of measurable environmental results as evidenced by past reclamation work:
A)	Elimination of denuded lands and their associated sediment loading to surface water.  To date, DMME’s Orphaned Land Program has revegetated 628 acres of denuded land.  At an average site erosion potential of 100 tons of sediment /acre/year and an average erosion & sedimentation control efficiency of 84%, this equates to 52,752 tons of sediment that are no longer entering surface waters each year (Based on research performed by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control).  Under the terms of this work plan, work will take place on three orphaned land project sites which will result in a further 9 acres being revegetated.  This will result in the potential elimination of 756 tons per year of sediment to Virginia’s waterways.  
B)	Closure of open or partially open mine shafts/pits.  These shafts/pits are often used for waste disposal and their closure results in the complete elimination of this conduit for groundwater contamination and associated surface water contamination via groundwater recharge. To date, DMME’s Orphaned Land Program has closed over 200 abandoned mine shafts/pits.  Under the terms of this work plan, over 100 shafts/pits are proposed for reclamation, eliminating them as conduits for groundwater into abandoned mine workings.
C)	Measurable attenuation of acid mine drainage (AMD) as evidenced in the improved conditions in Knights Branch produced by the Valzinco Mine Reclamation Project.  In this project pH rose from pre Phase I values of 2.5 at one representative monitoring station to post Phase I values of 4.5 at the same station.  Under Phase II of the Valzinco project, pH values rose to 5.1 as measured by the USGS monitor contracted for water quality monitoring work.  Similar attenuation of AMD is expected from the projects under this work plan.

Goal: Technical assistance and implementation support of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, streambank and shoreline erosion control to limit nutrients and sediment in runoff from urban lands.  

Introduction: The Virginia Stormwater Management Act of 2004, consolidated Virginia's stormwater management programs within the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and transferred oversight responsibilities to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board from the Board of Conservation and Recreation. This legislation has had a significant impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s stormwater management capability.  

Description: DEQ may provide funding and support in the form of sub-recipient agreements, training and technical assistance to local governments to help them adopt local stormwater ordinances or establish a comprehensive local stormwater program in the localities that currently do not have programs. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by DCR and contractual partners. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the local adoption of stormwater programs during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities.  Funds may also be used to provide professional training to localities in the development of their local programs, ordinance development, education and outreach, etc.

Results will include required corrective actions of reviewed local programs to gain compliance with state laws. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by these positions. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the program during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities. Staff will be involved in local projects as needed and as assigned by regional office or program management to address situational issues or to provide design recommendations.

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields


Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) base funding will be used to support the Nutrient Management Program Manager and the Nutrient Management Training and Certification Coordinator, both based in the DCR, DSWC central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 Nutrient Management Specialists. Two full-time and one part-time nutrient management specialists will be housed in agency watershed field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement Objectives 1, 2, and 5 of the Agriculture Chapter in the Virginia Nonpoint Source Pollution Management Program Plan. .  In addition this project implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan. As directed by Federal grant guidance, these positions will not be directly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES program responsibilities.

This activity is designed to provide engineering support for accelerated implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) in western North Carolina and continues work funded under the FY90-96 Section 319(h) grants. Water quality problems related to concentrated animal feeding operations and trout farms have been documented in the TVA counties and other counties in western North Carolina. North Carolina administers an Agriculture Cost Share Program which provides financial assistance to farmers to implement BMPs specifically for water quality protection.

Objectives
This program has been very popular among farmers, but the program has been limited by the availability of engineering assistance needed to properly design waste management systems for animal operations and trout farms. Providing this engineering support will accelerate the number of BMPs which can be implemented and will help farmers comply with the nondischarge rule for animal waste management adopted by the Environmental Management Commission in December 1992. Technical assistance would also be more readily available for future trout and animal farms to be designed so that water quality is protected. The cost of these activities will be shared with the Tennessee Valley Authority and local Soil and Water Conservation Districts.

The 64-acre Gibson Bottoms tract was purchased through the NC State Clean Water Management Trust Fund, the North American Wetland Conservation Act, and private donations.  It was originally purchased by a private developer for the development of a 200 site RV park which would have created the first point source discharge in the Little Tennessee River north of the town of Franklin, NC.  After the county commissioners denied a discharge permit, the developer sold the land to the Land Trust for the Little Tennessee.  Part of the tract was leased for cattle and hay management, and this lease remained in effect until recently.  The tract contains significant hydric soils and remnant wetland components.  Restoration efforts will restore this wetland and return the bottomland to a native riparian condition.  

Objectives
·	Using mechanical and physical labor, plug wetland drainage ditches and remove earthen berms. ·	Remove invasive exotic vegetation – privet, multiflora rose, Japanese honeysuckle, knotweed.  ·	Plant native wetland plant and tree species – sycamore, red maple, silky dogwood·	Host public media event during volunteer work days and upon completion of the project to show the goals and results of the project through local newspapers.

"85","items",NA,"ID",111788,"North Fork Coeur d'Alene River Streambank Stabilization Project ","$72,702","Project Overview:

This Project contains 3 site locations on the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. Site 1 is Approximately 0.4 miles up the old side river from the Little North Fork (Bumblebee) Bridge. Site 2 is Approximately 1.5 miles up the old side river from the Little North Fork (Bumblebee) Bridge. Site 3 is Approximately 1.8 miles upriver from Prichard off the main river road.

Objectives:

The proposed project encompasses approximately 900 linear feet of the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. The Shoshone County Road department and 1 individual private landowner are expected to participate in this project. Site 1.(47° 36.908'N, 116° 14.052'W). Approximately 0.4 miles up the old side river from the Little North Fork (Bumblebee) Bridge. At this site, the channel has split to the west and is impinging on the roadway for 615ft. A mid-channel bar is forming, forcing more water against the bank. The rock size is insufficient, and not reinforcing the fill toe. Additionally, there is erosion on an adjacent field that is adding more material to the river and meandering to expose more road fill. 

Site 2 (47° 37.254'N 116° 12.785'W) Approximately 1.5 miles up the old side river from the Little North Fork (Bumblebee) Bridge. An extensive gravel bar is forming above the site, causing meander to the southeast adding material to the river and decreasing the riparian corridor on this side of the river (south side, providing shade). The return meander is hitting hard against the road prism for 80ft. 

Site 3 The upstream half of the site (approximately 200ft)has a vertical drop of 4-6 feet to channel bottom. The bank is rounded cobble and can be very unstable.

The expected outcomes and benefits from stabilizing the banks and re-vegetation at these 3 sites are: reduction in sediment loss and its associated nutrients; reduction in solar loading to the river; and enhanced fish and wildlife cover and habitat.

Methods:

The most common bank stabilization treatment model incorporates woody vegetation (willow cuttings) underlying a rock armor and barb (if necessary). The shrubs grow through the armoring and over time, will eventually cover the armor. This shrub cover essentially conceals the rock armor to make the project sites more aesthetically pleasing. The cover also provides shade for aquatic species, nesting and roosting habitat for avian species, and essential habitat components for invertebrate species.","Y","Project Implementation","17010301","170103010702","N","06/01/2020",NA,"<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:111788"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>","N","<a href=""https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/grts/GRTSADM.download_my_file?p_file=212962&p_page=PROJECT"">Subbasin Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Loads of the North Fork Coeur d’Alene River</a> [Developing Plan], <a href=""https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/grts/GRTSADM.download_my_file?p_file=212965&p_page=PROJECT"">Upper (North Fork) Coeur d’Alene River Subbasin Temperature Total Maximum Daily Loads</a> [Updating Existing Plan]","Sedimentation-Siltation, Nutrients",72702

The Praire Dog Creek Watershed, HUC 10250015, is located in the northwestern portion of Kansas.   The watershed is aproximately 1030 square miles and falls within the Central Great Plains and Western High Plains ecoregions of Kansas.  With a population of less than 7,500, and less than 4% of the land cover of the watershed being urbanized or developed, this is a distinctly rural watershed.  Agriculture comprises the predominant activity within Prairie Dog Creek with cropland accounting for 57% and grassland 37% of land use within the watershed.  

As of 2006, Buffalo, Horse, Jack, Prairie Dog mainstem, Spring, and Walnut Creeks have a TMDL for dissolved oxygen issues.  Norton/Sebelius Lake and Colby City Lake both have a TMDL for eutrophication, and Norton/Sebelius Lake also has TMDLs for dissolved oxygen and pH.  During the summer and fall of 2009, KDHE will be developing a second round of TMDLs for impaired waters within the northwestern river basins of Kansas which will include the Prairie Dog Creek watershed.  

A WRAPS Development project is currently being completed within the upper portion of this watershed.  With this project, we will also include the lower portion of the watershed as well as the small portion of Harlan County Reservoir (HUC 10250009) that extends into Kansas.  This will allow us to approach the watershed more wholistically and engage in cooperative inter-state efforts with Nebraska.  Combining the lower and upper portions of Prairie Dog Creek this grant cycle will also give us the opportunity to solidify development efforts that have already occurred in the upper portion of the watershed, and it will allow the lower portion of the HUC to more easily follow suit on successful development and assessment activities that take place in the upper portion.  

With the agricultural and rural issues within Prairie Dog Creek in mind, we have compiled the list below to outline common problems within the watershed.  The continuing development phase will aim to gather more imput and perspectives from stakeholders within the watershed concerning these issues and others.  And, the assessment portion of our project will enable us to target areas of significant concern.  

1. Winter Feeding Sites/Concentrated Animal Feeding Sites - 
a. Feeding cattle at the well site 
b. Manure run-off 
c. Feeding cattle in bottoms 
d. Cattle standing in the water sources 

2. Failing Conservation Practices - 
a. Aging terraces are no longer as effective as possible and need to be restored in order to increase efficiency for load reduction

3. Abandoned Wells and improper Constructed Well Heads - 
a. Unplugged and improperly plugged wells need to be addressed with proper plugging and well head protection measures 

4. Failing Septic Systems - 
a. Need to close all open systems 

NOTE: These issues concern both Praire Dog Creek (HUC 10250015) and Harlan County Reservoir (HUC 10250009) that extends into Nebraska.



Objectives
1. Education through meetings and demonstration projects will be used to encourage and promote implementation of best management practices that will protect and restore water quality.  

2.  Establish solid Stakeholder Leadership Teams in both the Upper and Lower portions of Prairie Dog Creek and Harlan County Reservoir.  These teams will make decisions concerning WRAPS actions as well as help publicize WRAPS goals and activities.

3.  Assess the watersheds in order to determine areas where focused attention is needed.

We have received a grant for the Development Phase for the Keith Sebelius Lake/
Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS project. During this phase we toured the watershed
through the six counties. We held three Town Hall meetings in three different
counties during this phase. A Leadership Team was created. We acquired most
of these members through individual contact. Each member showed an interest
in our cause, and most have a specific interest from their background.
The current team members are:
Keith VanSkike - Kansas State Extension
Elaine Mann - City Council Member
Lee Juenemann - Upper Rep Basin Advisory Committee & Producer
Bart Brooks - Producer
John Miller - County Commissioner & Producer
Donna Hale - Conservation District Board Member
Robert Clydesdale - Conservation District Board Member & Producer
Cheryl Smith - Local Citizen
Diane Becker - County Economic Development
Steve Cox - Upper Rep. Basin Advisory Committee & Producer
LariAnn Nickell - County Conservation District
Twila Dizmang - County Conservation District
This team met as a group and discussed individually each and every concerned
listed from the Town Hall meetings. After discussion, through secret ballot
they voted on what they felt should be the top priority of concerns for a beginning
for our project. From these ballots, our priority list was created. The following list shows the public's concerns:
1. Winter Feeding Sites/Concentrated Animal Feeding Sites
2. Failing Conservation Practices
3. Abandoned Wells and Improperly Constructed Well Heads
4. Failing Septic Systems
Also, during this time we held different educational programs for the local
schools. We helped with several water festivals, and also assisted Farm Bureau,
Girl Scouts, and other Watershed coordinators with educational programs.
We have produced newsletters, news articles, and brochures which have been
distributed to the public. A powerpoint presentation was created and presented for
different local groups.
At present, we have completed the Development phase for the Keith Sebelius/
Upper Prairie Dog Creek. We are currently working with our second grant which
includes the Development and Assessment phase for the Lower Prairie Dog Creek
which runs from the Keith Sebelius Lake east through the rest of Norton County and
through the edge of Phillips County into Nebraska to the Harlan Reservoir.
We have toured the lower portion of our watershed. We have held a Town Hall
meeting in this community. We have continued to hold educational programs
for school age children, hold water festivals, produce newsletters, new articles.
We have had power point presentations for local groups. We continue to
visit with local producers about buffers as well as other practices which would
preserve our water quality. Leadership team meetings continue to be held.
We are currently working on a couple of projects which will be demonstration projects for our watershed: a rock cattle crossing
and a streambank stabilization/illegal dump clean up. We are working with NRCS staff and engineers on laying out the
design for these projects. We have worked on acquiring funding to help the producer with the cost of these projects. Once
these projects are completed, we will be creating a power point to be able to present to several groups through our watershed.
We believe that seeing a project from the beginning to the end, as well as seeing how it will make a difference in our water
quality will drive a good point home.
We have been visiting with Citizen Science to be able to bring water sampling training into our community as a form of adult
information and education. Moving into the planning phase, we will continue encouraging watershed residents to use the
monitoring kits. However, our project will focus on obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the existing monitoring
networks from which to gauge the present water quality and the impacts of BMP implementation throughout the watershed.

       The Prairie Dog Creek/Keith Sebelius Lake WRAPS development was established in 2006.  The watershed begins east of Colby, Ks and ends at the Keith Sebelius Lake west of the City of Norton. During the Development phase of this project we created a Stakeholder Leadership Team. This team met as a group and discussed each and every concern from Town Hall Meetings and other Public Meetings.  After discussion  the SLT through secret ballot voted on what they felt should be the top priorities for beginning our project.  From there a priority list was created.  Also during this time we held different educational programs for the local schools. We helped with several water festivals, and also assisted Farm Bureau, Girl Scouts, and other watershed coordinators with educational programs.  
        After completion of the Development Phase for the Prairie Dog Creek /Keith Sebelius Lake WRAPS Project, we applied for a second grant for the Assessment Phase and included the Development/Assessment Phase for the Lower Prairie Dog Creek.  The Lower Prairie Dog Creek would include the City of Norton east through Phillips County to the Nebraska State line.  We were awarded grant funding for this project in 2008 and the project was called Lower/Upper Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS.  We have added SLT members from this area to the current team to cover the entire Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS project.
        In the past year, we have been busy compiling a list of producers in the entire watershed that own or farm land within the watershed and TMDL areas.  The Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS project Management Team met five times in the last year to discuss upcoming and past events. 
       In February, our WRAPS project set up a display booth (including photos of the Keith Sebelius Lake when it flooded after heavy rainfall in May of 2008) at the Norton County Conservation District Annual Meeting.   We produced 3 brochures and handed out jar openers with the Prairie Dog Creek logo on them.  Approximately 200 people attended this event.
        In April, the Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS co-sponsored with the Solomon Vally RC&D a Landscape, Lawn & Garden Workshop for residents in Norton and surrounding areas.  We set up a display of our WRAPS project and handed out brochures and fact sheets about the watershed.  We also provided all attendees with notepads and pens to take notes during the day.  A simple survey was completed by the attendees about our watershed and general knowledge about water in our area.  Fifteen people attended.
        May was another busy month as we presented a water program to 19 local Headstart Preschool kids ages 3, 4 and 5.  We took ""Drippy"" our mascot and told his story about when it rains and the path that ""Drippy"" follows with his friends to finally end up back in the clouds to rain again.  The kids got to dip cotton balls in water and see how full they got, then squeeze them to make it rain.  The enviroscape is always a big hit with the young kids as they see how pollutants get into our water from everyday things they do at home.  We talked about different things they could do at home to help prevent water pollution.  Also, in May we presented a powerpoint presentation to the local Rotary Club about what buffers can do for Kansas water quality.  Eighteen people attended.
        In July, we set  up a booth at the Norton County Fair.  We had brochures available and gave away free bottles of water with the Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS logo on them.
        August 6, 2009 we had water sampling training through Citizen Science and  tested water from 4 different TMDL areas of Prairie Dog Creek watershed.  Four people attended and the program lasted about 4 hours.
       In September, we assisted the KNRF with WACKY(Wildlife,Agriculture, Conservation, Knowledge for Youth) Day, 260 area 6th and 7th grade students and 40 adults attended the all day event. The students rotated through different stations with conservation being the theme of each station.
        November was a busy month as we presented programs to the area schools about soil layers and conservation programs to promote water quality.  We produced 2 power point presentations, posters and a display.  The kids got to make edible soil layers and we talked about how rain water becomes ground water and then how it is used for wells for houses, livestock and irrigation.  The presentations each lasted about 35-40 minutes and was presented to 502 students and 42 adults.
        The Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS project has been promoting buffers through a Buffer Coordinator.  The coordinator has spoken to 17 local producers  one on one to promote buffers. The coordinator has worked with NRCS and FSA staff to find ways to promote buffers and grassed waterways.  Currently Norton County has approximately 300 acres committed to buffer practices.

Objectives
We will be looking at improving water quality through cost sharing with producers in our watershed for failing conservation practices.  One practice will include terrace redesigns and rebuilds.  Many terrace systems were applied in the 1960-70s and have far exceeded their life expectancy.  Coupled with recent heavy rains the effectiveness of the terraces has deteriated and are in need of reconstruction or redesigning to meet current needs.  Implementation of this practice will help reduce the Phosphorus load allocation for meeting the  EU TMDL for the Keith Sebelius Lake .We will be cost sharing with producers in our watershed to address this failing practice.  Designs will be made according to NRCS specifications and regulations. 



Methods
The method that we will be using will be to work with watershed and TMDL producers to assist with cost share for the rebuilding of terraces.  We currently have a list of producers that have shown an interest in cost sharing to help them repair damaged terraces or redesign terraces for todays farming practices.   We will make other producers aware of our cost share assistance through newsletters, news articles, direct mailings and our website.

Personnel will continue to work on our 9-Element Watershed Plan which is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2011, but will be completed no later than fall of 2012.  The LT will meet annually to review and revise this plan.

We will work with State, Local, and Federal agencies to obtain most current information for the the watershed.

Will work to acquire funding for cost share for producers

Will work with KDHE Planning Section to obtain TMDL documents and assistance with targeting BMP implementation throughout  the watershed

Will continue to hold SLT and public meetings

The Soil Tunnel Trailer is a mobile, museum quality, learning experience to educate the youth and adults in Kansas about soils in Kansas and the interaction of the natural resources underground. Several agencies/organizations are working together to see it come to life. There will be professional designs on the inside and outside of the trailer bringing the world of soil to life. Participants will feel like they are walking through an underground tunnel once inside. The eye catching, hand painted soil profile horizons on the exterior of the trailer are hard to miss as the trailer travels up and down Kansas roadways.

The importance of soil education is important for not only every human being on earth but also for the organizations/entities who appreciate and have a connection to, and a vested interest in, the importance of soil. And as we all know individuals are more and more disconnected from living in communities where soil is a part of how we make a living. A large part of our population in Kansas has lost touch with how many everyday products start in the soil. Not only those mentioned earlier, groceries, fuel, and fiber, but also hobbies and entertainment such as golfing, hunting, fishing, and racing. The RCCD would like to focus on how crops affect and can benefit our everyday life and put all the possibilities out there for the young and old to think about.

This project will have educational materials on the inside walls. Each element will have its own caption in English and in Spanish. The elements include the soil profile, benefits from the organisms found in soil, water quality non-point source issues such as illegal dumping and failing septic systems which effect soil quality as well. Other elements include how soil is formed, aquifers and sedimentary stone formation. Fossils are also touched on.

This project will also include educational stations. The number will be determined by the available funds. It is proposed to have a ""Soil Painting Station"", ""Crop Station"", ""Rainfall Simulator Station"", and ""Rubbing Station"". The Rubbing Station are templates the youth use in the soil to make critters come to life.

There will be several target groups varying in age and background so it is our goal to keep adding educational stations each year so that there are 4 or 5 options to present to each target audience. The potential with educating the public is endless with this project.

The SLT has reviewed our Watershed Plan and decided to start our second Implementation phase by July 2012. BMPs have been selected by the SLT to address NPS pollution. The end results will be based on acceptability by the landowners, cost effectiveness, and pollutant load reduction effectiveness.

The BMPS for High Priority Area 1 for the Upper Prairie Dog Creek and Lower Prairie Dog Creek are; rotational grazing, terraces, terrace rebuilds, nutrient management, buffer/filter strips, and field borders. We will be looking at improving water quality through state cost share programs, NRCS programs and other agency programs that the producer my qualify for. We will concentrate our efforts towards High Priority areas 1 in both the Upper and Lower Prairie Dog Creek as well as Norton Lake.

Management practices being targeted through the second year of our Implementation phase will be a continuation of our first year by continuing to promote the BMPs that are addressed in the Watershed Plan. STEPL results are showing that the portion of the watershed with higher estimated nutrient load is below the North Fork Prairie Dog Creek and the Prairie Dog Creek, so as a first priority we selected areas below the confluence as the initial priority for the Upper Prairie Dog Creek, consequently we will begin by targeting these areas first. During run off events, the land closest to Sebelius Lake would be more likely the area that would be having the most run off with nutrients and sediment reaching the lake. Farther up the watershed the run off would tend to have more of a chance to be absorbed. Treatment of high slope
cropland would help to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff from cropland, thus keeping nutrient and sediments out of the Prairie Dog Creek and Sebelius Lake. High priority area 1 for the Upper Prairie Dog Creek includes the area of the City of Clayton northeast to the Norton Lake Dam. Huc 12s, 1025001150205, 102500150206, 102500150207.
The slope of the land in this area averages a 3 - 10 slope. We will be looking at the higher sloped cropland which are closest to the lake.

Lower Prairie Dog Creek currently has a draft TMDL for total Phosphorus. the Lower Prairie Dog Creek TMDL indicates that decreased Phosphorus loading on the portion of the Prairie Dog Creek below Norton Lake will likely result in the ability to meet water quality standards. Water quality data show that a decrease in Phosphorus loading at monitoring station SC230 could produce the load reductions necessary to meet this TMDL. Therefore HUC12s, 102500150302 and 102500150303 were selected as High Priority area 1 for the Lower Prairie Dog Creek. This area is located from Calvert northeast almost to the City of Long Island.

Objectives
Objective 1: Our objective will be to improve water quality through educating and cost sharing with producers in our watershed for BMPs that we have addressed in our Watershed Plan.

Objective 2: The Prairie Dog Creek WRAPS project assistant will continue to provide informational and educational activities to residents of the Prairie Dog Creek watershed.

Methods
Methods 1: We will work with producers in the High Priority 1 areas of the Prairie Dog Creek Watershed Plan to educate them on the importance of these practices. We will also help them secure cost share to be able to put the practices on the ground. NRCS staff will be made available to help answer questions the producers might have, as well as make sure the
practices are installed according to NRCS or other authority standards. BMP information within the Prairie Dog Creek Watershed Plan is as follows:

The BMPs noted for implemented within calendar year 2013 as reflected within the Prairie Dog Creek Watershed Plan are as follows:

FY2005 SECTION 319 PROJECT SUMMARY – IOWA
Project #14


TITLE:  Clean Water – Lyon County Demo

LOCATION:  Lyon County, Iowa 

BACKGROUND/OVERVIEW:  Lyon County is located in the far northwest corner of Iowa, and is bordered on the west by the Big Sioux River, which is included on Iowa’s 303(d) list of impaired waters.  The county is one of the leading livestock production counties being ranked 3rd for cattle and calves, and 6th in hogs and crops, mainly corn, soybean with smaller amounts of hay and grass.  

Lyon County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) received two previous Watershed Development Grant from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship/Division of Soil Conservation to study and inventory feedlots and cow/calf entities throughout Lyon County.  Information obtained during these studies was entered into AGNPS, a computer model developed to analyze water quality of runoff from feedlots.  These results indicate feedlot discharges are contributing to the water quality impairments of the Big Sioux River.  In addition, these results allowed the operations to be prioritized in terms of actual or potential water quality impacts.

This project will establish demonstration sites at 6 non-permitted feedlots in Lyon County.  The demonstration sites will be chosen using several criteria, one being the results of the AGNPS model.  These demonstration sites will use alternative, cost effective measures to maintain or grow cattle feeding business in Lyon County in an environmentally friendly manner.  The 6 sites will be established on various sized operations.  Water quality monitoring will be conducted at each site to document results of the demonstrated technologies.  In addition, a comprehensive information/education program will be conducted to promote these technologies not only in Lyon County but throughout northwest Iowa.

Funding is provided to support a part-time staff person and associated costs, and financial incentives for demonstration site development.

FUNDING LEVEL:  FY2005 Section 319 fund request $204,500


TIME FRAME:  Three years (FY2006- 2008)


LEAD AGENCY:  Lyon Soil and Water Conservation District

The project will develop a user-friendly handbook with the assistance of a regional steering committee.  The primary goal is to educate a target audience of homeowners, contract septic system installers, realtors and other related professionals in the four county area surrounding Truman Lake on the soil potential ratings and local regulations for on-site waste water systems.  The overall objective is to improve and maintain water quality of Truman Lake relating to residential effluent. 

The project is primarily an information/education project.  The educational component will target the aforementioned audience.  A series of educational meetings to introduce soil potential ratings, current county on-site wastewater treatment system regulations, and environmentally sensitive areas surrounding Truman Lake will be conducted.  Additionally, the project will produce an interactive website with linkage to other sites containing soil maps, soils data and soils interpretations that can be downloaded for local use. 


Objectives
1. Development and distribution of the  “Truman Lake Area On-Site Treatment Soil Potential Ratings” handbook.
2. Conduct four training and educational meetings targeting land users (e.g. homeowners, realtors, contract septic system installers) located in the Truman Lake area.
3. Develop on going continuing education program for on-site wastewater treatment for land users in the four county area surrounding Truman Lake.


Methods
A steering committee will be formed for the purpose of guiding the development of the user-friendly handbook, educational meetings and continuing education classes.  The project will 1) gather and sort soil potential ratings, 2) develop a soil potential rating methodology and analyze soil data to determine household wastewater treatment, drain fields, alternative and/or lagoon systems, 3) determine any environmentally sensitive and fragile areas within the four county area, and 4) gather local regulations relating to on-site wastewater systems.  This information will be compiled and discussed in the Truman Lake Area On-Site Treatment Soil Potential Ratings Handbook and on the interactive web site.

The project will conduct at least four training and educational meetings (one per county) to discuss the regionalized soil potential ratings handbook and on-site wastewater treatment system regulations and other concerns.  The training and educational meetings will be announced in at least four new releases. The handbooks will be distributed during the educational training meetings and will be made available at each the four county health departments, soil and water conservation districts, and cooperative extension service centers.

The study’s primary research tool was a water quality monitoring program used to gather data at 4 main stem locations and 10 tributary sites.  Stream bank erosion assessments were made at several locations along the lower reach of the Redwood and Cottonwood Rivers.  Fishery surveys were used to assess populations and species diversity.  Land use and physical characteristics of the watersheds were analyzed through application of Geographic Information System (GIS) data layers.  These evaluations were supplemented in the Cottonwood River by field observations using the tailored integrated stream and watershed assessment (TISWA) methodology. 

Objectives
The goal of this project is to continue best management implementation according to the Phase I Implementation Plans and implement phosphorus reducing conservation practices that will help achieve the Lower Minnesota River dissolved oxygen TMDL.  This work plan is projected to reduce phosphorus reaching the Minnesota River by 1.139 tons annually or 911,683 pounds of aquatic plant growth annually (plus 1,960.50 tons of sediment).

Brief Project Summary & Problem Statement  
The 57.2-square mile stretch of the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River encompassing both  Lincoln and Lyon counties was designated as “impaired” because it is deemed unable to support one of its designated uses – swimming. The designation was based on the analysis of approximately 64 water samples collected between October 22, 1990 and May 17, 1999 at milestone site YMS-10.1, South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River at CSAH-10 near the city of Minneota. The sample results revealed frequent violations of state water quality standards for fecal coliform bacteria. Accordingly, the impaired branch of the Yellow Medicine River was subjected to the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program of the Clean Water Act (1983).


Objectives
he water quality impairment of excessive fecal coliform bacteria loading in the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River is being addressed by the coordination of services by several organizations. In order to meet the required goal set forth by section 303d of the Clean Water Act of 200 organisms per 100 ml of water (180 organisms per 100 ml of water with the MOS) in the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River, these organizations including but not limited to the Yellow Medicine River Watershed District, the Lyon and Lincoln Soil and Water Conservation Districts and NRCS agencies, the Zoning and Environmental Services for both Lincoln and Lyon counties, the MN Department of Agriculture,  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and Area II Minnesota River Basin will coordinate their services in a technical committee for the implementation phase of the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River (SBYMR) TMDL.  In addition to the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River Implementation Plan, there has been an implementation plan to reduce the loading of total phosphorous (TP), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Nitrate-Nitrite (NO2-NO3) in the greater Yellow Medicine River as a whole by 25%. This implementation plan has been in effect since 2001 and is called the Clean Water Partnership or CWP. Both the South Branch YMR implementation plan and the CWP implementation plan will be run simultaneously within the parameters of their respective goals.  
The Yellow Medicine River Watershed District (YMRWD) will act as the sponsors of the South Branch YMR Implementation plan. 
Priority Areas for All Management Measures 
Implementation of all strategies will occur in prioritized succession.  The initial focus will be based on sub watershed #20.  Sub watershed 20 is clearly the largest loading source in terms of magnitude and loading per unit area.  Sub watershed 20 is also located at the source of a tributary of the South Branch watershed, and will be a priority focus of the initial implementation.   
 
The implementation plan will initially focus on manure management, riparian buffer strips, and feedlots and septic systems within 100 meters of the streams.  Feedlots and ISTS’s more distant from the streams will be addressed in subsequent years in a progressive manner moving further from the streams.  Similar sequences will be used for tillage and nutrient management as well. Stream buffers will be targeted at priority locations based on the severity of the pollution sources in a given stream reach.   
 
Priority Sub Watershed 20 
Intensive monitoring will follow each significant level of implementation to document the performance of the control measures put in place. Hopefully, with local acceptance by the landowners, sufficient Fecal Coliform control measures will be implemented throughout the South Branch TMDL watershed wide and especially within sub watershed 20 to determine the effectiveness of the control measures, and project the ultimate success of the plan within the 15 year time frame.  Alternatively, if the control measures implemented prove ineffective or show limited performance, new or innovative measures for Fecal Coliform control will need to be evaluated and implemented to keep the plan on course with the water quality goals. 
 


Methods
The Yellow Medicine River Watershed District staff and board managers will partner with the Lincoln and Lyon SWCD organizations, the Lincoln and Lyon County NRCS agencies, and the Lincoln and Lyon County Environmental offices to form a technical committee.  The technical committee will meet regularly to discuss and present projects, and approve project proposals for use of the implementation funding for best management practices. The watershed district will continue to monitor the water quality of the South Branch of the Yellow Medicine River for signs of improvement of the water quality, and for signs of problems that will assist with priorizing the locations most in need of installation of best management practices.

The horse and intensive livestock community is identified as a major source of nutrients to Ventura River and its tributaries. Storm water from horse/livestock facilities may carry nutrients from unmanaged manure in to the river and infiltrate to groundwater. VCRCD will work with facility owner/operators to design nutrient management plans, provide individual site analysis, and encourage BMP implementation. There will be an emphasis on community involvement by providing outreach opportunities such as coalition group and stakeholder meetings This project will identify the distribution of horse and livestock facilities to estimate highest nutrient loads and critical areas and develop load reduction strategies. Prioritization of sites will ensure assistance and resources are offered to these critical areas for BMP demonstration sites. 

Objectives
Project will develop nutrient management plans for a minimum of 15 horse and livestock properties within high priory areas of the watershed.  One property will serve as a demonstration site for recommended BMPs.  A model will be developed to calculate estimated nutrient load reductions in the watershed based on sites with approved nutrient management plans.  

Methods
The grantee will provide a minimum of ten site visits and develop design plans for BMP implementation. Specific design plans will be created for each site, suggesting BMPs based on the individual site’s needs for manure and general property management. Based on previous design plans executed by the Ventura County Resource Conservation District (VCRCD), an average of 5 to 10 BMPs will be suggested in each design plan. This number will vary as it is dependent on size and location of property. BMPs in this project will focus on manure management, runoff control, structural improvements, and pasture/soil enhancement.","N","Project Implementation","18070101","180701010104","N","04/01/2016","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:98335"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>","N",NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen",147000

sing a targeted and interactive process. Work will involve using monitoring station and remote sensing data to detect irrigation mismanagement followed by installation of an interactive suite of on-site irrigation and nutrient management technologies to help growers assess irrigation and nutrient management practices. This project will expand on previous efforts to expand the use of effective irrigation and nutrient management measures by providing training on the use of irrigation and nutrient management practices with known efficacy, including soil moisture sensors, soil nutrient testing, nutrient budgeting, and on-site evapotranspiration measurements. This project is a part of the State's larger efforts to improve water use efficiency to protect access to local water supplies, protect water quality, and mitigate against climate change.

Objectives: This project shall enlist at a minimum of five nutrient irrigation management (NIM) stations each in the Calleguas Creek and Santa Clara River Watersheds. Properties with these stations shall reduce nitrogen amounts in lysimeters by 20% and reduce the number of irrigation-related deep soil saturation events by 70%.  Each NIM station will complete nutrient budgets.  Overall nitrogen applied will be reduced at 15% and project properties shall reduced irrigation water applied by 15%.

Methods: This project shall enlist Grower Cooperators to install Nutrient and Irrigation Management (NIM) stations on properties in drainage areas (responsibility areas) which have nitrogen exceedances and high leaching potential, reduce the amount of nitrogen leaching beyond the root zone of agricultural crops on properties with NIM stations, increase grower understanding of need for nitrogen reductions and expand the use of NIM station technology with the goal of reducing water and nitrogen, and decrease use of water and fertilizers on properties with NIM stations.

"108","items",NA,"SC",89460,"Catawba River WARMF Model Update","$118,000","Overview
The Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF) uses several sets of time series data as inputs to drive model simulations: meteorology, air & rain chemistry, point sources, reservoir surface elevation, reservoir releases, and diversions.  Measured flow and water quality data is collected to determine how well the simulations match historical in-stream conditions.  The database is currently complete from 1992 through 2005. 

Systech will collect data from the various sources and update the WARMF model database so it will be able to simulate through at least September 30, 2011.  For some input data such as minor point sources, data may need to be estimated by extrapolation from previous years if current data is not available.  Although input data used to drive simulations will be collected for the entire watershed, Systech will only collect calibration data from the South Carolina portion of the watershed to minimize expense.


Objectives
To allocate TMDL loading, SC DHEC needs to separate out those areas whose loading is regulated by other means.  This includes the boundary between North and South Carolina and MS4 permitted urbanized areas.  Current catchment delineation follows natural drainage boundaries which cross these administrative boundaries.  The WARMF catchments east of the Catawba River will be split along the state boundaries and MS4 boundaries provided by SC DHEC.  Septic systems in each split catchment will be allocated proportionally with respect to area unless Systech is supplied a septic system database from SC-DHEC.  River segments will be split as well if they can be divided cleanly into reaches which receive North Carolina and MS4 loading versus those receiving only South Carolina loading.  Some river reaches will inevitably be receiving loading from multiple jurisdictions, however.



Methods
Systech Water Resources will deliver the updated Catawba River WARMF model as an install set via FTP site or CD.  Systech will prepare and deliver a technical memorandum describing the modifications made to the model and the results of the model validation.  Upon receipt of deliverables, Systech will provide any as-needed support to SCDHEC staff in assessing the effort and conclusions presented in the completed tasks.

The Big Horn River and most of its tributaries were listed as threatened or impaired in the Wyoming DEQ 2002's 303(d) List. The designated use not supported for these streams was contact recreation. The cause of impairment for all streams was fecal coliform bacteria counts. The South Big Horn Conservation District, hereinafter referred to as “the District,” applied for and received 319 funds in 2002 to implement a water quality monitoring program on the listed streams. The data is currently being compiled and the monitoring is ongoing, with the initial data showing some unacceptably high fecal coliform results. Because the District is mostly comprised of agricultural operations and rural homesteads, we have assigned projects that focus on AFO (animal feeding operations, i.e. feedlots and working corrals) and faulty or inadequate septic systems a high priority in our funding efforts for water quality improvement. We will be addressing both of these efforts as part of our upcoming Watershed Plan in 2006. For this project, we will be addressing the AFO segment of non-point sources. 2.2 	Description of Waterbody and Map The streams listed as impaired on the 303(d) List are the Bighorn River (HUC10080007), the Nowood River (10080008), the Greybull River (10080009), Granite Creek (10080010), and Shell Creek (10080010). Those streams listed as threatened include Paintrock Creek (10080008), Beaver Creek (10080010), and Dry Creek (10080011). All streams are Class 2AB. Data is not yet able to correlate intermittent stream pollution contribution, however, a map of the above-mentioned streams is included in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) to show intermittent stream proximity. The biggest stream is the Big Horn River, which flows north from the Boysen Reservoir toward Montana. It has varying flow depending on reservoir discharge. The Nowood River has the longest main stem length, highest sinuosity, largest watershed, and highest mean annual discharge within the South Big Horn Conservation District. Beaver Creek is the steepest and least sinuous, with its flow confined mostly to the Big Horn Mountains. Dry Creek is the only stream not flowing from the mountains, which makes it the shallowest and flattest of the streams. Shell Creek is much steeper and less sinuous where it flows in the mountains, and gradually becomes more sinuous as it approaches Greybull. It, along with Beaver Creek, and the Greybull River, also experience varying flows due to reservoir discharge levels. As can be expected in arid regions, suspended solids and turbidity in these streams increases dramatically during a storm event. For this reason, weather data is being collected during water quality sampling. Both warm water and cold water fisheries are contained within the District and are home to Rainbow and Brown Trout, Channel Catfish, Saugar, and Bullhead, as well as many aquatic insects. The historical water quality on these streams is comprised primarily of “grab” data, which is one-time analysis. While some of this data shows water quality violations, the District has been unable, with the assistance of a scientist, to show trends or make source conclusions. The initial data collected by the District in 2001 correlates the high suspended solid result during a storm event. Chemical profiles were also done, and further chemical tests were deemed unnecessary by the Steering Committee as the results were within normal range. Further fecal coliform/e.coli sampling was requested during the recreation period, was funded by the FY2002 319 grant, and showed some e. coli and fecal coliform high results, but no conclusive trends. The District feels with a few more years of data, some causes and relationships may be determined. This will be further addressed in the District’s Watershed Plan, to be submitted in 2006. 2.4 	Watershed Description The climate for the Big Horn River Watershed varies with elevation and location.

The South Big Horn Conservation District, in partnership with the Water Quality Steering COmmitte, and the County Engineer/Planning Office, seek to conduct a pilot project to test several best management practices for their effectiveness in reducing fecal coliform pollution in the watershed, monitoring the results to compare with current base data, and educate the public about their role in pollution. 

Objectives
A residential septic system rehabilitation project, focusing on faulty or inadequate septic function that may contribute to non-point source pollution in the watershed.  A monitoring program designed to test for project effectiveness in affected watersheds.  A public education program about nonpoint source pollution from septic systems and animal feeding operations through public meetings, brochures, mailings, and press releases.  

Methods
The main outcome of this project will be to reduce fecal bacteria loading by a possible 25% in the Big Horn River Watershed to meet State standards for contact recreation and fisheries.  To achieve this outcome, the District will implement septic system rehabilitation cost share projects in 30 households located on or near high priority streams or shallow groundwater/well environments.  It will also conduct before and after monitoring upstream and downstream from the project areas to determine water quality improvement effects and load reduction, utilizing in-house testing and DEQ approved spreadsheets and models.  Finally, it will continue an education program targeting rural residents to inform them of proper septic system function and design and water quality issues.
Task 1:  The District will provide the necessary accounting, meetings, semi-annual and annual reports, and payment requests for the life of this project.  
Task 2.  The Big Horn County Planner/Engineer's Office will provide the technical assistance necessary to help landowners design adequate and legally permissible septic systems and issue all project participants a County septic permit before construction begins on individual projects.  They will utilize site/home visits to determin existing system status/efficiency.  A WACD developed questionnaire will be sent to all interested landowners and the DIstrict's WQ Committee will select participants based on watershed priority, a minimum rank of 100 on questionnaire, and site visit information/confirmation of potential water quality impact.

In 2006 the project sponsor requested additional funding for this project.  FY2002 base funds in the amount of $86,600 were consequently allocated to this project.  

Objectives
This project was designed to focus on agricultural non-point source pollution by administering a feedlot moving/rehabilitation project that fully conformed with EPA 2006 AFO/CAFO regulations.  A second goal was to implement a public education program about non-point source pollution from septic systems and animal feeding operations through public meetings, brochures, mailings, and press releases. 

Methods
Relocation of AFOs away from listed streams and septic system upgrades.","N","Project Implementation","10080010","100800100301","N","07/01/2004","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:41642"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,86600

Project Background:
The Beaverdam Creek watershed (HUC 10 #0307010111) is located entirely in Greene County, Georgia.  The watershed covers approximately 75,621 acres and includes all of the city of Greensboro and portions of Siloam and Union Point.  The watershed drains to Lake Oconee, an impoundment of the Georgia Power Company.  Although constructed for the purpose of generating hydropower, Lake Oconee is a major recreation destination.  Swimming, boating, and fishing are popular recreational activities. According to the Revised TMDL Implementation Plan, HUC 0307010111, Town Creek and Beaverdam Creek, April 2003, the watershed is one of the most heavily impacted by fecal coliform in the Northeast Georgia region. 

The HUC 10 watershed contains four impaired stream segments classified under the GA EPD 305(d)/303d list as not supporting their designated use of fishing due to violation of Georgia’s fecal coliform standard.  Those streams are:
•	Town Creek, (Highway 15 to Richland Creek) HUC 12 #030701011101 (4 miles)
•	Beaverdam Creek, (Oliver Creek to Lake Oconee south of Greensboro), HUC 12 #030701011103 (4 miles)
•	Richland Creek (upstream from Greensboro to I-20), HUC 12 #030701011101 (9 miles)
•	Richland Creek (I-20 to Little Creek), HUC 12 #030701011104 (3 miles). 

Land use in the watershed is comprised of urban, agricultural, and silvicultural uses.  Agriculture is primarily beef and dairy cattle, and limited poultry.  

The Revised TMDL Implementation Plan for Town Creek and Beaverdam Creek, attributes non-point source (NPS) loads to cattle with direct access to streams, high impact areas with runoff directly connected to streams, leaking or damaged sewer lines (in Greensboro), urban runoff, storm sewers, illicit discharges, and leaking or failed septic tanks.  High impact areas are assigned to either urban (impervious surface) or agricultural (heavy use or loafing areas of displaced soil and concentrations of livestock waste). Town Creek, a tributary to Richland Creek, is the discharge recipient for the Greensboro South Wastewater Treatment Plan.

Analysis of the Town and Beaverdam creeks revised TMDL Implementation Plan identified the following steps for load reduction:
•	continued implementation of proposed ordinance adoptions and revisions;
•	detailed targeted sampling to localize the source of pollutants; 
•	implementation of urban and agricultural BMPs specific to identified sources;
•	educational outreach regarding agricultural BMPs and septic tank maintenance; and,
•	evaluation of the effectiveness of plan implementation utilizing the BASINS model. 

The TMDL Implementation Plan for Richland Creek, 2001, attributes NPS loads to malfunctioning septic tanks, illicit direct discharge of residential or commercial wastewater into tributary streams, animal waste from livestock, pets, and wildlife, and storm water runoff. Richland Creek also serves as the discharge recipient for the North Greensboro Wastewater Treatment Plant. 

Analysis of the Richland Creek TMDL Implementation Plan identified the following steps for load reduction:
•	formation of a watershed team representing Greene County, Greensboro, public works, NRCS, Cooperative Extension, Greene County Health Department, and Greene County Environmental Codes Enforcement to work on fecal coliform reduction; 
•	formation of a stakeholder’s group to identify issues of concern, offer input to and feedback on plans, participate in outreach education, and recruit support from the community; 
•	educational outreach on sources of urban and agricultural fecal coliform; contamination and on minimizing the impact of fecal coliform bacteria on stormwater; 
•	compiling additional data to support plan development; 
•	water quality monitoring to identify potential fecal coliform sources to target for abatement; 
•	ranking potential sources of contamination; 
•	evaluation of need for and feasibility of adopting a septic tank inspection ordinance; and,
•	funding for urban and agricultural BMP practices.

The revision and consolidation of the three TMDL Implementation Plans into one watershed management plan for the Beaverdam Creek HUC 10 watershed will address the following: 
•	Refine source assessment to identify, locate, and prioritize potential pollution sources through visual survey, monitoring, land use, and stakeholder input.
•	Provide for assessment and characterization of current conditions.
•	Assess effectiveness of current management measures.
•	Identify, recommend, and prioritize management practices that will achieve project objectives and improve water quality.
•	Identify critical areas in the watershed where management efforts should be directed.
•	Define outeach goals, identify target audiences, identify and update outreach activities, and establish criteria to evaluate success of outreach programs. 
•	Develop implementation schedule to support plan objectives.
•	Develop long-term monitoring plan.
•	Develop criteria to evaluate and revise plan.

Additionally, collection of current water quality monitoring data will be necessary to reflect the shift in agricultural land use from dairy to beef cattle and poultry as well as provide data for the source assessment and a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of project implementation on water quality.	 
•	Implement pre-BMP monitoring to provide current data for the source assessment; 
•	Implement post-BMP monitoring to measure the effectiveness of installed practices and long-term load reduction;
•	Engage volunteers through a River’s Alive event for Town Creek; 
•	Engage and certify volunteers to assist with water quality monitoring; and 
•	Provide for education and outreach on water quality-related issues identified in the WMP.

Objectives
Project Goals:
•	Revise the individual fecal coliform TMDL Implementation Plans (TMDLIP) for four stream segments - Beaverdam Creek, Town Creek, and Richland Creek (2) - and compile the revised TMDLIP into one plan for the Beaverdam Creek watershed (HUC 10 #0307010111) that meets the US EPA’s Nine Elements for Watershed Planning; and

•	Through implementation of urban and agricultural BMPs, improve water quality for fecal coliform bacteria in each impaired stream by an estimated 20 percent, resulting in an anticipated adjustment in the TMDL-required load reductions as follows:
o	Beaverdam Creek – reduce from 75% to 60%
o	Town Creek – reduce from 60% to 48%
o	Richland Creek (u/s of Greensboro to I-20) – reduce from 20% to 16%
o	Richland Creek (I-20 to Little Creek) – reduce from 94% to 75%.
(Total Maximum Daily Load Evaluation for Seventy-Two Stream Segments in the Oconee River Basin (Fecal Coliform), January 2007)

•	Educate citizens on the watershed’s water quality issues by conducting one stream clean-up and two workshops.

•	Establish a permanent Watershed Partnership responsible for plan implementation, evaluation, and revision.

Using the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Recovery Potential Screening Tool (2014), GAEPD has developed a process for nonpoint prioritization of watersheds for restoration and protection efforts at a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed level.  The top 20% of watersheds (176 individual HUC 12 watersheds) were selected, identified in the NHD Watershed Boundary Dataset, and a GIS shapefile was created based on the selected 176 watersheds.  These priority watersheds will guide GAEPD’s 319(h) competitive grant funds, other GAEPD efforts including potential compliance assurance efforts and GAEPD’s partners’ nonpoint source control activities.

The GSWCC and cooperating agencies developed the Best Management Practices for Georgia Agriculture Manual to promote the voluntary adoption of BMPs. This manual is designed to provide the agriculture community with knowledge of the best management practices (BMPs) that work to protect surface water quality as well as to help agency personnel educate farmers about BMPs and their usefulness. It is a compilation of conservation practices that address surface water quality and includes an estimate of the effectiveness and relative cost of each BMP. 

Agriculture is a dominant land use in the State and can lead to degraded water quality if BMPs are not implemented. Nationally, agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the leading source of water quality impacts to surveyed rivers and lakes, the third largest source of impairments to surveyed estuaries, and a major contributor to ground water contamination and wetland degradation (National Water Quality Inventory, USEPA, 2004). Some agricultural activities that have been identified as contributors to nonpoint source pollution include animal waste runoff, land cultivation, irrigation, improper application of fertilizers and pesticides, livestock over grazing, and unconfined watering. The major agricultural nonpoint source pollutants that result from these activities are sediment, nutrients, pathogens, and agrichemicals.

In the past, GSWCC has received Section 319(h) Grant funds to implement BMPs in a number of watersheds throughout the state.  These watersheds included: Sugar Creek, Richland-Beaverdam Creek, Upper Chattahoochee, Little River, Nevils Creek, Upper Coosawattee River, Upper Satilla River, Upper Ochlockonee River, Upper Broad River, and Middle Coosawattee River.  BMPs that were installed in these watersheds primarily consisted of Alternative Watering, Heavy Use Areas, Fencing, and Waste Management (see attachment). 

For this project, the GSWCC will use the attached map and list of priority watersheds to install additional BMPs.  These watersheds should be identified towards long-term goal of delisting waters not meeting water quality standards.

In addition, GAEPD currently has contracts with several organizations that are implementing agricultural BMPs, these include; Chestatee-Chattahoochee Resource Conservation and Development Council (RC&D), Golden Triangle RC&D , Oconee River RC&D, Limestone Valley RC&D, River Valley RC&D, Seven Rivers RC&D, and Northwest Georgia Regional Commission (map attached).  GSWCC may want to consult with these organizations during its process for selecting watersheds. 

In order to use a Section 319(h) Grant provided through the Federal Clean Water Act such funds must be spent in accordance with Georgia’s 2014 Nonpoint Source Management Program Plan (NPSP), a statewide comprehensive approach using long and short term goals, implementation strategies, and milestones that can lead to reductions in nonpoint source pollution.  The use of BMPs on agricultural lands is covered in the NPSP in the Agriculture Section as one of the available strategies to address nonpoint source pollution, and as fully supporting the State’s efforts to prevent, control, and abate nonpoint source pollution. Such lands include, but are not limited to those that help improve water quality, reduce impact of erosion, and preserve stream and river buffers.  


Objectives
Implementation of water quality improvement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in selected HUC12 watersheds identified on Georgia’s list of priority watersheds (attached).  Watersheds that are selected will be on Georgia’s 305(b)/303(d) list categorized as not supporting designated uses.  The primary focus will be on impaired water bodies due to agricultural runoff.

 Revised effective May 7, 2012 with the second amendment.

The goal of the Lewis and Clark Watershed Implementation Project is to restore the beneficial uses in Lewis and Clark Lake, and the watersheds of Lewis and Clark Lake, Geddes, Academy, Platte Lake and Lake Andes Lake.  This will be accomplished through the installation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the watersheds that target sources of sediment, nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Initiated during 2006, Project Segment I targeted BMPs only in the 56,000 acre Corsica Lake subwatershed.  In 2007 the Segment I Expansion added the East River portion of the watershed with 747,000 acres.  This project, Segment III, will properly address and target BMP installation in the entire South Dakota portion of the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed (1.9 million acres) and will also provide technical and financial assistance to the watershed activities in the Lake Andes, Geddes, Academy and Platte Lake Watersheds.  These additional four watersheds add up to 560,000 additional acres and are tributaries of the Missouri River and Lake Francis Case which lies upriver and borders the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed.  The total project area acreage is now 2,465,000 acres.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This proposal is the third segment of a locally planned multi-year (10-15 year) effort to implement best management practices (BMPs) in the Lewis and Clark Lake watershed, Lake Andes, Geddes, Academy and Platte Lake Watersheds.  This effort is aimed at restoring water quality to meet designated beneficial uses and address TMDLs established, and to be established, for water bodies in these watersheds.

"123","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

Watershed-based management planning typically occurs through six steps:
1.	Building partnerships,
2.	Characterizing the watershed,
3.	Finalizing management goals and identifying solutions,
4.	Designing an implementation program,
5.	Implementing the watershed-based management plan, and
6.	Measuring progress and making adjustments through adaptive management.

This project will proceed through the first four steps – building partnerships; characterizing the watershed; finalizing the vision, mission, goals, objectives, and management practices (i.e., solutions); and designing the implementation program.  The results of these four steps will be documented in the nine element watershed-based management plan.  Project tasks are described below.

Task 1 Build partnerships:  FTN will work with the Lower Little River Watershed Coalition (Coalition) to facilitate the formation of a team to champion the development and implementation of the WMP, emphasizing the socioeconomic benefits that can accrue to all stakeholders from restoring segments of the Lower Little River and its tributaries.  In addition to the Coalition, key stakeholder groups in the Lower Little River watershed will include, but not necessarily be limited to: Arkansas Farm Bureau; The Nature Conservancy; US Fish and Wildlife Service; and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

Task 2 Characterize the watershed: FTN will review existing studies and models of the Lower Little River watershed, the existing watershed management plan, and reports of BMP projects, and, if needed, further identify sources and causes of pollution (Plan element 1).
 
Task 3 Finalize management goals and identifying solutions: FTN will work with the team to create a vision, mission, and management goals and objectives for the Lower Little River watershed.  It will also determine the load reductions needed (Element 2), critical areas for management, and management actions/practices to achieve the management goals (Element 3).

Task 4 Design an implementation program: In conjunction with the team, FTN will design a program for implementing the goals and solutions, emphasizing the socioeconomic benefits that will accrue to the stakeholders when the plan is implemented.  This will involve estimating funding needs, and identifying funding sources (Element 4), developing information and education activities (Element 5), an implementation schedule and milestones (Elements 6 and 7), and identifying indicators and a program for monitoring and tracking progress (Elements 8 and 9).

Task 5 Prepare nine element watershed-based plan:  Utilizing the information gathered during tasks 2 through 4, FTN will prepare a nine element watershed-based plan for the Lower Little River.  This plan will be reviewed by the team, ANRC, and EPA, and their comments incorporated.

Task 6 Reporting: All reports will be prepared and submitted (hard copies and electronically) according to the grant requirements.
1.	Quarterly reports will be submitted utilizing the format/forms provided electronically by ANRC and will briefly state accomplishments made for each task.
2.	Final Report will be submitted to ANRC at the completion or the end date for the project. A Final Report Guidance will be provided by ANRC in outline form.  The Final Report should be a narrative description and should encompass all activities (from start to finish) related to the project.  An executive summary as well as a final outcome and/or conclusion section shall be contained in the Final Report.  A minimum of two copies of the report are required.

The nine element watershed-based management plan that results from this process will be submitted to EPA for review and approval. After this project is completed, the nine element watershed-based plan will be implemented by local and agency stakeholders.


Objectives
The objective of this project is to prepare an EPA-accepted nine element watershed based plan for the Lower Little River NPS priority watershed, while developing local support for the plan and its implementation.

The key to successful implementation of any water quality initiative is the acceptance by the stakeholders that it is necessary and that it will produce results worth the efforts and resources they must supply. This requires not only sound physical science, but also economic feasibility. This proposal will develop both the economic and physical information needed for producers and others in the Upper White River watershed to make informed decisions regarding water quality improvement plans in their area. The proposal will leverage off of current economic and environmental monitoring and modeling in the Shoal Creek watershed and different Stone and Barry county representative farm characteristics. This effort will incorporate computer modeling of the entire watershed. Management alternatives within the James River watershed will be assessed in detail while an aggregate assessment will be done for the rest of the watershed. The model will include waste treatment plant discharges as well as urban and agricultural non-point sources of nutrients, sediment, and bacteria. This proposal is paired with a complimentary 319 proposal submitted to the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality by the Arkansas Water Resources Center, University of Arkansas that will focus on King River and Beaver Lake. In addition, this effort will be coordinated with the broader Upper White River Watershed Initiative. These coordinated efforts will allow a comprehensive assessment to be completed within the two-to-three-year timeframe. The varying levels of detail as well as the combined efforts in Arkansas and Missouri will allow the entire process to be completed during the project and still be able to address detailed management alternatives and monitoring in strategically selected subbasins. Water quality impacts on Table Rock Lake will be the focal point of the analysis, but the process will provide indicators of stream water quality and agricultural economic viability as well.

Objectives
1. Establish a coordinating committee within 3 months for the Upper White River basin in cooperation with the local organizations and the state and federal agencies. 2. Assess the effectiveness of the phosphorus restrictions defined in the phase I of the TMDL implementation plan for the James River by simulating James River water quality impacts for 10 to 50 years into the future within 6 months of project start. 3. Publish maps and reports based on comprehensive assessments of the Upper White River that combine the Missouri model based assessments with the Arkansas model assessments that locate and quantify the sources of nutrients in the Upper White River basin that impact the lakes' water quality within 18 months. 4. Work cooperatively with the Upper White River Water Quality Project Office, EPA and Missouri state agencies to provide measures of economic and environmental effectiveness of 3 to 5 alternative management practices for use in stakeholder decision making. Management alternatives are expected to include nutrient management levels and transport of manure or municipal sludge to land outside the watershed. Alternatives will be developed by the coordinating group and amended to include alternatives developed by the forum participants. 5. Increase the understanding of the local population of the combined effects on the lakes water quality of alternative urban and agricultural management practices and regulations by producing comparative maps and charts and publishing reports that use stakeholder provided data and model simulation of alternative management practices. 6. Increase the understanding of the local population of the means for affording these alternative management practices by identifying the economic incentives necessary to support the cooperative efforts of the stakeholders. 7. Summarize in reports and presentations to stakeholders the information necessary to enhance the watershed management plan developed at the April 2003 Water Quality Summit identifying economically and environmentally acceptable strategies.

Methods
* FAPRI will conduct a series of computer modeling scenarios designed to predict the effectiveness of water quality measures, their efficacy, their cost and the available incentives within the next 10 years and for the following 40 years within the entire Upper White River Basin. * The Upper White River Basin Coordinating Committee will find and utilize all available data sources to determine where data gaps exist.

This project will focus on the James River Basin in Southwest Missouri and is approximately 931,050 acres or 1455 square miles in size.  Portions of seven counties (Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, and Douglas) drain into the James River and eventually drain into Table Rock Lake with a portion of the watershed part of Springfield public water supply.  A major portion of the James River watershed is currently on the 303(d) list for nutrients with 59 miles of the river shown as being impacted by both urban point and non-point source pollution.  This project will focus on sources and reduction of urban non-point source pollution within the James River Basin. The specific goals of the project will be accomplished by watershed planning, water quality monitoring, modeling and education and outreach. The project will focus on creating awareness of the roles that the local citizens have in the improvement or degradation of water quality in the region.  Urban best management practices (BMP’s) will be installed to reduce or eliminate water quality problems cause by urban stormwater runoff in residential, commercial, and municipal areas of the watershed.  Although the project activities would occur throughout the entire watershed, BMP implementation will be focused in Cities of Nixa and Ozark where urban development is rapidly occurring. A Watershed Management Plan will be developed for the Middle James River (HUC 11010002020001, 11010002020002, 11010002020003) and Finley River (HUC 11010002030004) sub-watersheds as an early milestone and prior to implementation of best management practices.  The plan will include the essential nine (9) critical elements of a watershed plan as identified by the US Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, JRBP will work with the Christian County Soil and Water Conservation District to assist and coordinate planning efforts in developing the Finley River WMP.

The James River Basin Watershed is located in southwest Missouri, in the heart of the Ozarks.  The watershed is approximately 931,050 acres or 1455 square miles in size.  Portions of seven counties (Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, and Douglas) drain into the James River and eventually drain into Table Rock Lake.  There are approximately 289 miles of streams with permanent flow, 74 miles of intermittent streams, and numerous losing streams within the basin. A major portion of the James River watershed is currently on the 303(d) list for nutrients with 59 miles of the river shown as being impacted by both urban point and non-point source pollution.  The James River watershed is high priority according to the released Unified Watershed Assessment where it ranks 5th out of 66 watersheds in Missouri.  High potential for groundwater pollution, urban non-point sources, high animal unit density, and moderate biological density are factors which contribute to the high ranking.  There are three impaired segments with in the James River watershed: Headwaters of the James River to Lake Springfield Dam; from Lake Springfield Dam to the confluence with the Finley Creek; from Finley Creek to Table Rock Lake.  The three main tributaries to the impaired segments of the James River include Pearson Creek, Wilson Creek, and Finley Creek. 
 
Project Description
This project will focus on the James River Basin in Southwest Missouri and is approximately 931,050 acres or 1455 square miles in size.  Portions of seven counties (Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, and Douglas) drain into the James River and eventually drain into Table Rock Lake with a portion of the watershed part of Springfield public water supply.  A major portion of the James River watershed is currently on the 303(d) list for nutrients with 59 miles of the river shown as being impacted by both urban point and non-point source pollution.  This project will focus on sources and reduction of urban non-point source pollution within the James River Basin. The specific goals of the project will be accomplished by watershed planning, water quality monitoring, modeling and education and outreach. The project will focus on creating awareness of the roles that the local citizens have in the improvement or degradation of water quality in the region.  Urban best management practices (BMP’s) will be installed to reduce or eliminate water quality problems cause by urban stormwater runoff in residential, commercial, and municipal areas of the watershed.  Although the project activities would occur throughout the entire watershed, BMP implementation will be focused in Cities of Nixa and Ozark where urban development is rapidly occurring. A Watershed Management Plan will be developed for the Middle James River (HUC 11010002020001, 11010002020002, 11010002020003) and Finley River (HUC 11010002030004) sub-watersheds as an early milestone and prior to implementation of best management practices.  The plan will include the essential nine (9) critical elements of a watershed plan as identified by the US Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, JRBP will work with the Christian County Soil and Water Conservation District to assist and coordinate planning efforts in developing the Finley River WMP. 


Objectives
Watershed Management Plan
The objectives of the watershed management plan are:

1. To protect and improve water quality in the watershed and Table Rock Lake by identifying pollutant sources
2. Identify better management practices to be implemented,
3. set reachable goals and timeline for implementation
4. Establish an evaluation and monitoring program to determine success of implemented projects/programs.
5. Increase success of future projects
6. To help determine where water quality efforts  should be focused 
7. Fulfill specific grant application requirements for securing future funding 
8. Assist other organizations and municipalities in water quality related efforts 
9.  Provide insight for creation of more efficient implementation and/or education budgets for future projects. 

Sources and Reductions of Stormwater Runoff in the James River Basin
The primary objectives of the watershed implementation project are:   
 
1. To educate general public of the effects of storm water runoff on water quality of the James River Basin by conducting 3 field days (to showcase storm water retention demonstration areas)  and 3 workshops (to provide results of monitoring project and to promote storm water retention practices). 
2.  To prevent potential nutrients from entering surface and groundwater by completing 150 urban soil test and nutrient management plans and enrolling 20 individual into the Show Me Yards and Neighborhoods program.                                                                                                            
3. Provide educational materials for a four year period including lawn care brochure, rain garden manual, 4 public service announcements focused on storm water runoff issues, handbook to sustainable living, and a quarterly newsletter to the general public that will promote awareness of storm water runoff issues and practices that can be implemented to reduce the amount of NPS pollution introduced into the James River Basin
4. Maintain a website and toll free water quality hotline to provide information on grant projects.
5. Reduce amount of NPS pollution entering the James River Basin by implementing storm water retention practices (conservation practices include: detention ponds and basins, filter strips, infiltration basins, mulching, porous pavement, seeding, storm water wetland, top soiling, tree and shrub planting, tree and shrub protection, swales) on 20 residential lots and 4 on commercial/municipal sites. 
6. To create a greater understanding of urban runoff in the Ozark region by storm water runoff monitoring for a one year period in residential areas with data collected analyzed and concluded in report released to the general public and a technical report submitted for publication in a scientific journal.   
7. To provide storm water education to 400 K-12 students by presentation, hands-on activities, and field trips.

Methods
 Watershed Management Plan: The JRBP will use a planning process that encourages local stakeholders participation and support. Throughout the process stakeholder public meetings will be held to identify watershed problems, major pollutant sources and management measures to be implemented.  The data and information obtain from stakeholders meetings, research and assessment will be compiled and used to complete a draft plan. The draft watershed management plan will be presented to both technical and advisory committees and the general public before finalizing.  The final plan will contain the nine critical elements of a watershed management plan as identified by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
 Education: Education programs will be implemented that focus on informing and educating the general public about water quality issues in the James River watershed. Program will be implemented that share practical and affordable stormwater practices that landowners can adopt to reduce storm water runoff.  Information will be distributed to the general public in the form of handbook/manuals, brochures, public service announcements, and newsletters.
 BMP Implementation: Implementation of the BMPs’ and demonstration projects will occur in three targeted areas which includes residential, commercial, and municipal sites. Practices, components and average costs to be offered through the program will be established within three months of the project start. Some of the practice that may be offer through the program includes detention ponds and basins, filter strips, infiltration basins, mulching, porous pavement, seeding, storm water wetland, top soiling, tree and shrub planting, tree and shrub protection, and swales. 
 Water Quality Monitoring and Modeling: Water quality monitoring and watershed modeling will be implemented where needed to obtain information ion NPS pollution loading from urban runoff in the targeted geographical area..  Sampling sites will be concentrated in two communities (City of Ozark and Nixa) on 20 residential lots.  Monitoring will be conducted by through contract services and volunteer citizens in the second year of grant.

The project will establish riparian corridors and preserve existing corridors by utilizing conservation easements. A Riparian Corridor Assessment conducted by the Missouri Department of Conservation will be completed to identified  high quality and poor quality riparian areas that the James River Basin Partnership can target for the easement program. Although the total watershed will be addressed, priority and targeted efforts will be given to two subwatersheds, Middle James River  (HUC# 11010002020001, 02 & 03) and Finley River (HUC# 11010002030001, 02, 03 & 04) sub-watersheds, which are contributing a large amount of nonpoint source pollution to the James River and impairing it’s water quality.  These sub-watershed are facing urbanizing pressures and contain agricultural areas that do not have adequate riparian corridor systems in place.  Educational efforts will include the development of  informational material and workshop to aid landower with understand the water quality benefits of riparian corridors and explain the conservation easement program . A model riparian corridor ordinance will be developed with the assistance of city and county representatives and presented to Planning and Zoning (P&Z) commissions

Objectives
The primary objectives of the James River Riparian Corridor Restoration and Protection project
are:
1. Develop and Implement a riparian conservation easement program
2. Retain 20 miles of riparian corridor systems in the conservation easement program 
3.  Enhance or establish 10 miles of riparian corridor systems in high priority areas
4.  Create an educational program for riverfront property owners on managing and protecting their corridor systems
5.  Create a model riparian buffer ordinance and present to city and counties officials within the James River Basin.



Methods
•	Education: An informational piece that introduces conservation easement opportunities will be developed and distributed throughout the watershed. This includes  the development and distribution of a riverfront property guide to landowners to help them understand the importance of riparian corridors and how they relate to the health of the stream water resources.  A workshop will also be developed and hosted throughout the watershed  that will focus on stream dynamics. The workshop will give watershed landowners a chance to learn more about watershed hydrology, biological aspects of streams, importance of riparian corridors, and practices that can be implememed on their property to enhance water quality
•	Conservation Easement Program:  The Conservation Easement Program will be a basin wide effort  that will target areas of the James River watershed that includes the Middle James, Finley, Lower James, and Table Rock sub-watershed in Christian, Greene and Stone Counties.  Landowners that wish to participate in the easement program will receive 100% of cost incurred for establishment of conservation easement.  These fees would include: land appraisal, alternative watering system, fencing for cattle exclusion, land survey and legal fees.  All easements will be required to have a minimum riparian corridor width of 100ft., measured from top of bank perpendicular from the stream. Livestock exclusion will also be required for all property that will be entered into the easement program
•	Cost–share for the Conservation Easement Program will be used in conjunction with other state and federal programs as an incentive to get restoration completed.  Two program  will be made available for landowners that volunteerily participate in the conservation easement program.
1.	Riparian Corridor Enhancement: The Enhancement program will offer 100% cost share as the incentive for landowners donating a conservation easement for perpetuity. These areas must exhibit less than optimal riparian corridor systems but have an established corridor system in place.  The participants in Enhancement program will receive 100% cost share for practices to establish trees/grasses,  stablilize streambank and address gully or excess soil erosion. 
2.	Riparian Corridor Establishment: Establishment program will offer 90% cost-share incentive for landowners donating a conservation easement for perpetuity. The remaining 10% of the practice cost will be the responsiblility of the landownwers. Cost-share assistance will be authorized for installing those practices needed to restore the corridor and improve water quality.  Practices such as establishment of trees/grasses, livestock exclusion, streambank stabilization and  others that address gully or excess soil erosion will be cost-shared.  
•	Riparian Buffer Ordinance:  A model ordinance will be developed with the assistance of city and county representatives for the James River watershed. Current existing ordinance througout the nation will be reviewed, along with any local ordinance currently in place. The model ordinance will then be presented to city/county officials and planning and zoning commissions in the James River Watershed.  JRBP, along with partners, will work to implement buffer ordinace througout the watershed.  
•	Watershed Modeling: This project aims to reduce the loadings of non-point source pollutants entering into the James River, which is on the 2002 303(d) listing, and its tributaries in Christian, Greene, and Stone counties. The targeted pollutants include nutrients (Total Phosphorus (TP) and Total Nitrogen (TN), and suspended sediment (turbidity).  Load reduction will be quantified by using RUSLE II for sediment reductions and the STEPL model will be used to determined load reductions for TN and TP.

Portions of seven counties (Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, and Douglas) drain into the James River and eventually drain into Table Rock Lake. There are approximately 289 miles of streams with permanent flow, 74 miles of intermittent streams and numerous losing streams within the basin. The topography, geology, and soils in the watershed are typical of the Ozarks. Slopes of the upland site range from around 2-15%, with 5-6% as an average. Soils on the broad ridges are relatively deep with many of the soil types containing medium amounts of rock fragments. The Ozarks, including the James River watershed, is well known for its karst characteristics. Sinkholes are present throughout the entire basin, especially in the Finley Creek and upper Flat Creek areas.

Land uses in the James River watershed include urban development, agricultural and forested area. Urban areas in the basin are estimated to be approximately 7%, which encompasses the metropolitan area of Springfield and many rapidly growing communities (Ozark and Nixa). 

Agricultural areas are approximately 63% of the watershed. Farming operations include beef and dairy cattle, hogs, poultry production, fruit crops, corn, feed and forage crops. The predominant agricultural use involves cattle operations. The remaining 30% of the land in the watershed is forested. 

The first objective of this project is to develop a nonpoint source WBP for the James River watershed in Missouri that includes the nine key elements critical to a WBP. The plan will outline goals and identify actions for surface waters within the watershed that do not meet water quality standards. Stakeholders from local governments, individual property owners, and representatives from community organizations will be involved throughout the planning process. The project will be a joint effort between The Board of Governors of Missouri State University on behalf of SMCOG and OEWRI; Ozarks Water Watch (OWW); and James River Basin Partnership (JRBP). 

The project will also include a technical analysis of the watershed to model nutrient loading and identify impaired areas within the James River watershed. Additional modeling will be conducted to analyze best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the loading of pollutants in priority areas. 

The objectives of the nine-element WBP are:
1.	Protect and improve water quality in the watershed and Table Rock Lake by identifying pollutant sources and gathering pertinent data.
2.	Identify conservation practices to be implemented.
3.	Set realistic goals and timeline for implementation.
 
4.	Establish an evaluation and monitoring program to determine success of implemented projects/programs.
5.	Increase success of future projects.
6.	Help determine where water quality efforts should be focused.
7.	Fulfill specific grant application requirements for securing future funding. 
8.	Assist other organizations and municipalities in water quality related efforts. 
9.	Provide insight for creation of more efficient implementation and/or education budgets for future projects. 

The second objective of the project will be to implement a demonstration septic replacement project within the Crane Creek – James River Watershed (HUC 1101000205). This project will serve to remediate failed or poorly functioning septic systems and replace damaged or undersized tanks and/or lateral fields. Septic effluent contains high amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous and microbial contaminants. By remediating failed septic systems, the potential for contamination of these pollutants to the watershed will be reduced.

The average cost of septic remediation in this area, as determined by the ongoing 7-year DNR/EPA State Revolving Fund grant, Septic Remediation Program administered by Ozarks Water Watch, is $13,000 per system (this includes tank replacement only up to advanced drip systems with rock breaking and imported soil). The proposed 319-demonstration project would focus on remediating a minimum of 5 systems in the Crane Creek-James River Watershed. Each participant that meets the requirements would be offered 50% of the cost of remediation, up to $10,000 per system. In order for the homeowner to qualify, the Septic Regulator for the County or a licensed Septic Inspector would deem the septic system as failing. If there is a drinking water well on the property, a water test would be performed before and after remediation to determine if the failing system was contaminating the well. If an advanced system [low pressure pipe system (LPP) or aerobic treatment unit system (ATU) with a drip field] is installed, then a maintenance agreement would also be required to insure continued proper functioning of the system. Educational material regarding proper maintenance and treatment of septic systems will be provided to every homeowner receiving financial assistance. A final invoice signed by the installer and the homeowner will be provided before any money is distributed. Collection of the homeowner cost-share is between the installer and the homeowner. Payment of 50%, not to exceed $10,000, will be made to the homeowner upon completion of the project and receipt of all required documents.

Phase 1 of the project was previously funded out of a 604(b) grant. For this reason, certain elements within the schedule of milestones are already partially complete.

Agricultural areas are approximately 63% of the watershed. Farming operations include beef and dairy cattle, hogs, poultry production, fruit crops, corn, feed and forage crops. The predominant agricultural use involves cattle operations. The remaining 30% of the land in the watershed is forested. 

The first objective of this project is to develop a nonpoint source WBP for the James River watershed in Missouri that includes the nine key elements critical to a WBP. The plan will outline goals and identify actions for surface waters within the watershed that do not meet water quality standards. Stakeholders from local governments, individual property owners, and representatives from community organizations will be involved throughout the planning process. The project will be a joint effort between The Board of Governors of Missouri State University on behalf of SMCOG and OEWRI; Ozarks Water Watch (OWW); and James River Basin Partnership (JRBP). 

The project will also include a technical analysis of the watershed to model nutrient loading and identify impaired areas within the James River watershed. Additional modeling will be conducted to analyze best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the loading of pollutants in priority areas. 

The objectives of the nine-element WBP are:
1.	Protect and improve water quality in the watershed and Table Rock Lake by identifying pollutant sources and gathering pertinent data.
2.	Identify conservation practices to be implemented.
3.	Set realistic goals and timeline for implementation.
 
4.	Establish an evaluation and monitoring program to determine success of implemented projects/programs.
5.	Increase success of future projects.
6.	Help determine where water quality efforts should be focused.
7.	Fulfill specific grant application requirements for securing future funding. 
8.	Assist other organizations and municipalities in water quality related efforts. 
9.	Provide insight for creation of more efficient implementation and/or education budgets for future projects. 

The second objective of the project will be to implement a demonstration septic replacement project within the Crane Creek – James River Watershed (HUC 1101000205). This project will serve to remediate failed or poorly functioning septic systems and replace damaged or undersized tanks and/or lateral fields. Septic effluent contains high amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous and microbial contaminants. By remediating failed septic systems, the potential for contamination of these pollutants to the watershed will be reduced.

The average cost of septic remediation in this area, as determined by the ongoing 7-year DNR/EPA State Revolving Fund grant, Septic Remediation Program administered by Ozarks Water Watch, is $13,000 per system (this includes tank replacement only up to advanced drip systems with rock breaking and imported soil). The proposed 319-demonstration project would focus on remediating a minimum of 5 systems in the Crane Creek-James River Watershed. Each participant that meets the requirements would be offered 50% of the cost of remediation, up to $10,000 per system. In order for the homeowner to qualify, the Septic Regulator for the County or a licensed Septic Inspector would deem the septic system as failing. If there is a drinking water well on the property, a water test would be performed before and after remediation to determine if the failing system was contaminating the well. If an advanced system [low pressure pipe system (LPP) or aerobic treatment unit system (ATU) with a drip field] is installed, then a maintenance agreement would also be required to insure continued proper functioning of the system. Educational material regarding proper maintenance and treatment of septic systems will be provided to every homeowner receiving financial assistance. A final invoice signed by the installer and the homeowner will be provided before any money is distributed. Collection of the homeowner cost-share is between the installer and the homeowner. Payment of 50%, not to exceed $10,000, will be made to the homeowner upon completion of the project and receipt of all required documents.

Phase 1 of the project was previously funded out of a 604(b) grant. For this reason, certain elements within the schedule of milestones are already partially complete.

The James River Basin contains approximately 1,455 square miles and includes portions of eight counties in the southwest part of the state: Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, Wright and Douglas counties. Headwaters of the James River originate in Webster County. The river then flows generally southwesterly about 150 miles through Greene, Christian and Stone counties – receiving major tributaries at Pearson Creek, Wilsons Creek, Finley Creek, Crane Creek, and Flat Creek – to its outlet in Table Rock Lake south of Galena. Local partners developed a watershed management plan for the James River Basin to address water quality impairments and concerns in the watershed, in conjunction with addressing challenges posed by rapid urbanization of parts of the watershed, the watershed’s predominantly karst nature and mining heritage, and coupled with the need for protection of waters important for drinking water supply and recreation.

Land-uses across the basin vary widely. Agriculture predominates in the upper and lower ends of the basin, with urban and suburban uses in the central part of the basin. Nearly 50% of the land in the James River Basin is in agricultural uses, with cattle raising the most prevalent type of farming use. Most of the livestock are on grasses, and grasslands make up about 47% of the land-cover in the basin. Cultivated croplands comprise less than 1% of the James River Basin. Forests make up about 38% of the land-cover in the basin. And urban and suburban development now make up about 11% of the James River Basin land-use.

Water quality impairments have been identified in the James River Basin. A TMDL was approved in 2001 and updated in 2004 to address nutrient impairments in the James River. The nutrient concern in the James River was significantly addressed by wastewater treatment plant upgrades, but nutrient levels in the river remain above the desired or “target” levels in several areas. Since the approval of the James River TMDL for nutrients, the James has been listed as impaired for E. coli. A number of other water bodies in the James River Basin have also been listed as impaired: Pearson Cr, Wilsons Cr, and Galloway Cr, Ward Br – E. coli; Pearson Cr, Wilsons Cr, and Crane Cr - Aquatic Macroinvertebrate Bioassessments; Jordan Cr – PAHs; N Branch Wilsons Creek – Zinc; Lake Springfield and Table Rock Lake – Chlorophyll-a. NPS is the primary cause of impairment in the James River Basin.

This leverage project anticipates the implementation of various agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented by the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) located within Stone, Christian, Barry, Lawrence, Greene, Webster, Wright and Douglas counties that address the water quality impairments and/or concerns for nutrients, sediment and E. coli in the James River Basin. The agricultural cost-share practices implemented through the county SWCDs that address sediment, nutrients and bacteria will be captured as leverage (see Attachment 2 for a BMPs Mode of Action document for additional information). Cost-share practices implemented within prioritized areas that address both the water quality impairment and the water quality concerns noted in the watershed plan will be tracked and annually summarized for leverage dollars and pollutant load reductions.

Objectives:
The goals of the James River Leverage project are consistent with the goals of the watershed plan:
•	Improve the quality of waters within the James River basin that are listed as impaired,
•	Guide future implementation of voluntary conservation practices funded by Missouri’s nonpoint source pollution program (§319), and
•	Provide direction for multiple agencies and programs working to address water quality issues in the James River Watershed.

The objectives of the James River Leverage project are consistent with the objectives of the watershed plan:
• Reduce pollution loading into waterbodies that are designated as impaired through either the state’s §303(d) list or through the establishment of TMDLs;
• Direct funding assistance where it is most needed and will do the most good in order to achieve applicable water quality standards for all impaired waterbodies; and
• Restore and maintain designated uses for impaired waterbodies by using a variety of BMPs that are most effective at protecting water quality for the given pollutants and their sources.
 
Additionally, the primary objective of this project is to provide leveraging for the FY17 grant by capturing practices implemented through the Soil and Water Conservation Program that fall within the critical areas and align with the objectives of the James River Watershed Management Plan. 

Methods:
This leverage project is intended to capture cost-share dollars spent by the Soil and Water Conservation program, so only SWCP cost-share BMPs will be entered for this project. WBP focus for BMP implementation relevant to this project is on improving or restoring vegetative buffers along streams, livestock waste management, pasture and forage grass improvements, and streambank stabilization. Practices recommended to be implemented as stated in the WBP include: cropland BMPs (no-till, cover crops, crop rotation, vegetative buffers, filter strips), livestock BMPs (livestock exclusion fencing with off-stream watering systems, rotational grazing, grazing management plans, vegetative stand improvement, retention basin or pond, poultry waste management), and streambank stabilization and riparian corridor improvement. As these types of practices are implemented within the defined critical areas of the plan, the amount of state funded cost-share will be captured here as leveraging. Load reductions for sediment, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus will also be reported.","Y","Project Implementation","11010002","110100020305","N","10/07/0017","On Schedule","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:118020"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>","N","<a href=""https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/grts/GRTSADM.download_my_file?p_file=227881&p_page=PROJECT"">James River Watershed Management Plan - Appendix C, D, and E</a> [Implementing Plan], <a href=""https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/grts/GRTSADM.download_my_file?p_file=226573&p_page=PROJECT"">James River Watershed Management Plan</a> [Implementing Plan]","Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)",0

The EMT Basin Assessment will provide an assessment of overall water quality in wadeable streams and rivers throughout the EMT.  This will be accomplished by monitoring a complete gradient of watershed conditions.  

Objectives
a)Estimate overall water quality and ecological conditions of wadeable streams within the EMT by monitoring MUs that represent the complete gradient of watershed conditions.  

b)Provide data that can be used to categorize each wadeable and nonwadeable monitoring reach in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report. 

c)Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at each of ADEM’s established Ecoregional Reference Reaches, as well as additional sites in least-disturbed MUs, within the EMT to support development of ecoregional reference conditions and nutrient criteria. 

d)Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at existing CWA §303(d)/TMDL stream and river segments, as well as some of the most-disturbed watersheds within the EMT to support ADEM’s CWA §303(d)/TMDL and Nonpoint Source Management Programs. 

e)Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at randomly-selected wadeable stream reaches representing the full range of watershed conditions of wadeable streams within the EMT to develop indicators that link chemical, physical, and biological conditions within each reach to conditions within its watershed.  These data can then be used to develop nutrient criteria and to revise ADEM’s biological and habitat assessment guidelines to more accurately assess ecological conditions within each reach. 

f)Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at priority watersheds identified by ADEM’s Nonpoint Source Management Program to assess the effectiveness of BMPs implemented through Alabama’s CWA §319 Program. 




Methods

This project is of particular significance since it addresses a management measure and condition of the State’s Coastal Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program.  In this project, Texas AgriLife Research will work with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to provide financial assistance to implement Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone addresses outstanding condition No. 4, New and Operating Onsite Disposal Systems, of the Texas Coastal Nonpoint Source Pollution Program.  To address this outstanding condition, Clean Water Act Section 319 funds will be provided to Texas Agrilife Research to conduct reconnaissance, public outreach, inspect OSSFs, and if needed pump primary septic tanks, and also if needed replace failing OSSFs.

Objectives
This project will reduce the overall loading of contaminants to watersheds under the jurisdiction of Section 6217.  Contaminant loading will be reduced through public awareness and behavioral change.  Proper maintenance practices to ensure systems are properly functioning will be emphasized.  The replacement of malfunctioning OSSFs will provide additional reduction of contaminant loading to the watershed.

Methods
An evaluation of critical areas with OSSFs that can potentially contaminate water resources is planned by Texas AgriLife Research in cooperation with the Galveston County Health District.  An evaluation of critical areas in other coastal counties will be planned.  Information regarding site conditions will be collected about the areas using OSSFs.  The relevant information can include development density, soil type, land surface elevation, depth to groundwater, system age, and complaint history.  The project partners will evaluate the information and select sites for site investigations.  Project partners will visit identified areas to verify collected information relative to actual site features.  A final listing of targeted critical areas summarizes the results of reconnaissance visits. 

Public outreach meetings provide a means to share project information and identify potential sites for conducting a visual evaluation of OSSFs.  The public meetings facilitate sharing information on operation and maintenance activities for keeping OSSFs operating properly.  These meetings are planned for areas identified as potentially providing contaminants to water resources due to failure or malfunction of OSSFs.  The participants will receive copies of the visual evaluation procedures and requests for candidate systems to conduct the evaluation.  An incentive for participating in the evaluation process will include the pumping of the septic tank component of the anaerobic OSSF.  An additional incentive capable of overcoming the apprehension of participants regarding the identification of a malfunctioning system is the resources to replace the system.

The purpose of this project is to implement year 22 of the Rotating Basin Monitoring Program (RBMP) and continue monitoring efforts for priority watershed projects.  Implementation of the RBMP will allow for the assessment of the beneficial use support status of streams in the relevant watersheds, the collection of information about nonpoint sources of pollution, and the evaluation of success of NPS implementation and education efforts by this and other programs. Implementation monitoring efforts will continue necessary data collection to evaluate water quality and other impacts of ongoing priority watershed implementation projects (e.g., NWQI, RCPP).

Objectives
Oklahoma is committed to monitoring and systematically identifying waters and associated watersheds threatened or impaired by NPS pollution based on Oklahoma water quality standards.  The specific action for identifying NPS threats and impairments is to monitor water quality and the integrity of the aquatic community and habitat in approximately 300 streams in the State through a rotating basin approach concluding every five years.  

The objectives of this portion of OCC’s program include providing the staff support, vehicles, laboratory analysis, supplies, contracting, and travel costs to: 
•	Identify NPS threatened and impaired waterbodies to give an accurate assessment of Oklahoma’s water quality as affected by NPS pollution;
•	Identify sources and causes of NPS pollution as well as land use and best management practices that prevent NPS pollution from threatening waterbodies;
•	Gather needed data to more intensively assess streams where impairment is identified to verify the causes of impairment, identify categorical and geographical sources and to gather other data needed to allow planning restoration strategies; 
•	Check water bodies previously identified as affected by NPS pollution to determine if threats or impairment continue;
•	Evaluate successes and failures of various controls, best management practices, and education programs aimed at improving and protecting water quality.

The education and outreach component of the project will provide greater awareness of the pollutant loading sources and methods to reduce impacts from those sources to the citizens of San Juan County.  The resulting public support for the rivers and voluntary implementation of pollutant reduction techniques by local residents will provide greater protection for the rivers and water quality improvements.

The outreach effort will also increase local awareness of the SJWG and our mission and goals.  This will strengthen the SJWG’s position as an advocate for water quality protection and improvement and increase membership and participation within the group.

Objectives
The SJWG proposes an E. coli pollutant load reduction goal of 1.87 x 1010 cfu/day.  The goal was developed from the Stevens Arroyo Monitoring Report (2006) and the companion Stevens Arroyo Baseline Report (2007).  (Both reports are on the enclosed cd and the monitoring report is available online at the NMED/SWQB website at http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/swqb/wps/San_Juan/StevensArroyoMonitoringReport-2006.pdf.)  E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo is extremely variable during the year.  In 2007 the average E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo was 3.00 x 1011 cfu/day.  The SJWG estimates 25% of that loading (7.5 x 1010 E. coli cfu/day) is attributable to the practices of livestock grazing and penning along the Stevens Arroyo and livestock grazing of flood irrigated pastures.  The SJWG goal is to reduce the above loading by 25%. 

...

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local property owners/managers willing to implement appropriate BMPs.  Priority will be given to those areas identified in the Source ID Final Report as significant sources of bacterial and nutrient loading.  Property ownership will be determined through the San Juan County Assessor’s Office and other appropriate sources.  Owner identification and contact information is available from that office.  

Methods
Based on land use and activity, the pollutant load reductions will be achieved by implementing appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs) using two approaches.   The first approach is to work cooperatively with the United Stated Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to implement BMPs with local agricultural producers.  The NRCS administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) which provides cost-share funds to working farms and ranches for conservation improvements.  One of the program’s national priorities is the “reduction of non-point source pollution, such as nutrients, sediment, pesticides, or excess salinity in impaired watersheds, consistent with Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) where available, as well as reduction of groundwater contamination and conservation of ground and surface water resources”.  

The project’s goal will be the implementation of agricultural BMPs on irrigated bottomland located in the valley areas of the watershed adjacent to or in relatively close proximity to the rivers and perennial streams.  The SJWG estimates that this represents approximately 25% of the 29,000 total acres of irrigated lands in the watershed, exclusive of the Navajo Agricultural Products Incorporated (NAPI) lands.  BMPs for these properties include:
•	Manure management
•	Riparian access management for livestock
•	Soil conservation BMPs
•	Conversion to efficient irrigation systems
•	Fertilizer management
•	Vegetated buffers.

The project includes the following activities to accomplish the BMPs. Voluntary implementation of grazing BMPs in the riparian area.  The most effective practices are complete exclusion of livestock from the riparian areas, or the creation of riparian pastures accompanied by careful management of the grazing resource, and provision of off-channel water sources.  

Voluntary implementation of BMPs to increase irrigation efficiencies (30% efficiency for flood irrigation), including irrigation scheduling (to avoid over-application of water – 35 to 40% efficiency), installation of gated irrigation pipe (50% efficiency), installation if sprinkler irrigation (80% efficiency), drip irrigation (95% efficiency) and to decrease irrigation return flows, including land leveling (to permit even watering with less return flow) and tailwater detention (to slow the return of overflow to the stream).  

The BMPs for flood irrigation will reduce bacterial and nutrient loading to the Animas, La Plata and San Juan River by increasing irrigation efficiencies, reducing water usage and reducing irrigation return flows.  Lower, or no, return flows from irrigated pasture and agricultural fields will reduce the quantity of bacteria and nutrients delivered to the receiving stream.  Livestock holding BMPs will remove the livestock from the stream banks and the revegetation of riparian areas will reduce the amount of manure and other animal wastes directly entering the stream and/or river. 

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local agricultural producers willing to seek EQIP funding.  EQIP funding is awarded competitively, but the ranking formula awards additional points for projects that benefit a CWA Section 319 funded project.  For the past three years the local work group, which advises the Aztec NRCS office on how to apply the Farm Bill and EQIP funding, has supported awarding additional points above those in the standard ranking formula to those projects identified by the SJWG which result in BMPs that improve water quality in the watershed.  Although total Farm Bill and EQIP funding varies from year to year, a minimum of $30,000 to $40,000 annually is expected to be available for EQIP projects during the term of this proposal.  Currently there are four agricultural producers participating in the EQIP/Section 319 partnership in the SJWG’s current Phase II project.       

For those agricultural producers interested in participating in water quality improvements, the EQIP program typically funds 50% or more of the agricultural producer’s costs.  EQIP funds are determined by NRCS from available price lists to establish maximum reimbursable rates for a wide variety of BMP related activities, such as fencing and irrigation equipment.  The 2010 payment schedule is 75% to 90% of EQIP costlist.  The 2010 payment schedule is available at http://www.nm.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/fotg/section-1/cost-data/2010/2010-costdockets.html.  During the current Phase II project, EQIP funding has varied from 60% to 80% of the project’s total cost.  The CWA Section 319 monies will be used to fund 60% of the producer’s EQIP cost share.

NRCS staff provides technical and design assistance for proposed EQIP projects.  Agricultural producers contract with NRCS to maintain the BMPs and related equipment in proper operating condition for 7 years following installation.  

Permits, certifications and clearances are not anticipated for these projects.  Any work in the riparian area should be conducted in conformance with the United States Army Corps of Engineer’s (ACE) existing nationwide 404 permit.

The second approach will be to identify willing private land owners and/or public entities, such as local and county governments and state and federal land management agencies, not eligible for EQIP to implement appropriate BMPs.  

CWA Section 319 funding will be used for property owners who are not agricultural producers but engaged in agricultural activity to implement the same BMPs identified above. (EQIP funding is only available to individuals who are engaged in agriculture for income.  Non-producers are individuals who do not derive income from their agricultural activities.  These include hobby farmers and individuals who have horses and other livestock for pleasure or personal consumption.)  Funding will also be used for private and public property owners/managers to implement stormwater management, stream channel and steam bed improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration BMPs.  The following stormwater related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Pervious surface installation in the urban environment in favor of impervious surfaces
•	Infiltration swales
•	Detention ponds/constructed wetlands
•	Stabilization and re-vegetation of erosional features and disturbed lands
•	Properly graded, constructed, drained gas field roads and other native surfaced roads.
•	Sand filters to intercept and treat piped municipal stormwater discharges

The following stream channel/bed improvement and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Removal of inappropriate riprap (car bodies, scrap metal, scrap concrete, etc.)
•	Bank stabilization
•	Re-channelization to improve sinuosity and hydrology
•	Creation/expansion of flood plain areas for sediment capture and vegetation recruitment
•	Wetlands restoration

For agricultural BMPs, NRCS can provide design and engineering assistance for property owners who are not agricultural producers.  The NRCS price list will be used as the basis for cost determination for applicable BMP design.  Stormwater management BMPs, stream channel/bed improvements and wetlands/riparian habitat restoration will be designed by appropriate engineers.  Clearances and certifications (archeological, cultural and historical) and permits for stream channel work from the Army Corps of Engineers and NMED will be obtained by the engineer or the property owner/manager.     

Bacteria and nutrient load reductions for agricultural BMPs were discussed above.  Stormwater related BMPs would provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by reducing the discharge of manure and other fecal wastes, fertilizer and sediment to the rivers from storm events.  Stream channel improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration will provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by restoring the natural function of the habitat, increasing assimilative capacity and reducing stream bank erosion.

...

A variety of indicators to measure success will be used depending on the type and location of the BMP implemented.  Water sampling for E. coli bacteria and/or nutrients may be used when agricultural BMPs are implemented within a sub-watershed with a perennial stream.  This type of measurement is consistent with the monitoring of the Stevens Arroyo and Shumway Arroyo watersheds being conducted under the Phase II project.  Water quality sampling will be for bacteria along the La Plata and San Juan Rivers and nutrients along the Animas River.  All projects will begin by establishing a relevant baseline(s) from historical sampling events, if available, and/or sampling events prior to implementing a BMP.  A post monitoring plan will determine a reduction in bacterial or nutrient loading.  

Appropriate pollutant load reduction models will be used for agricultural BMPs located in areas without perennial streams.  One such model is STEPL, which is a simplified spreadsheet tool for estimating the load reductions that result from implementing BMPs.  STEPL includes a management practice calculator that computes the combined effectiveness of multiple practices implemented in serial or parallel configurations (or both) in a watershed.  This model is preferred because users of the model are not required to have any specialized programming skills.  STEPL will be used for BMPs implemented in the Animas River watershed to model nutrient and sediment load reductions.

Currently there are no acceptable methods to model fecal and E. coli bacterial load reductions from BMP implementation.  Where possible, a sampling plan that includes the collection and analysis of water samples for E. coli bacteria will be developed to document pre- and post-BMP bacteria levels.  A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) will be developed and submitted for approval.  Sampling will conform to the QAPP approved as part of this project.    

Vegetative changes and recovery will be used to monitor the effectiveness of wetlands and riparian habitat restoration projects.  Visual and photographic documentation will be used for monitoring stream channel improvements.

Fall river is an important water resource that provides drinking water for municipal and domestic uses. Additionally, it provides water for livestock, other agriculture, recreational and industrial purposes. The Fall river basin has several designated high priority TMDLS where water quality restoration actions are needed. In particular, the head waters are impaired for fecal coliform bacteria. A watershed Restoration and Protection Plan is being developed by local stakeholders that will provide a basis for local action to address important water quality problems. Through water quality data and local input from citizens a immediate need to address fecal coliform bacteria has been identified

Objectives
The goal of this project is to reduce the fecal coliform bacteria count to TMDL levels and educate citizens about water quality issues and how their actions effect local water resources.

Methods
To accomplish the stated goal, the Project Management Team (PMT) will implement a information and education program that will include tours, workshops, news articiles, brochures, and demonstration sites. In addition, Best Management Practices (BMP's) will be installed to reduce fecal coliform bacteria as well as other pollutants from entering water sources. In particular a manure composting project will be implemented to address a concentrated manure source.","Y","Project Implementation","11070102","110701020205","N","01/03/2005","Accepted by EPA","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:5042"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen",34950

The lower part of the upper Verdigris/Fall River Basin is an important water resource that provides drinking water for several towns in the focus area. The area has several designated high priority TMDLS where water quality is in need of restoration. The impairments include low dissolved oxygen, sedimentation, and fecal coliform bacteria. A Watershed Restoration and Protection plan is being developed concurrently with Kansas State and these items have already been identified in the preliminary draft of the document. This project will address an assessment sedimentation concern and allow us to gauge the severity of the problem. This application for funding will also dovetail into the overall proposal from Kansas State Project No. K3-023. 

Objectives
The goal of this project is to identify areas of stream segment that is actively eroding and contributing to the sedimentation problems downstream. The thought process is to start with the least cost approach to BMP application to start making an impact on the stream system.  A report will be compiled that will include these deliverables in a report form:

1.	Aerial inventory of the streams to determine land ownership and potential stream bank erosion sites for the drainage area composed of the Verdigris river below Toronto and Fall River Reservoirs. This inventory will be completed using existing aerial photography and ownership maps. 
2.	Meetings will be held with identified landowners to receive their input on where the problem areas are on their property. 2 meetings in Wilson county, 1 meeting in Woodson county, 1 meeting in Elk county, and 1 meeting in Greenwood county.
3.	A physical survey will be completed on those stream segments that the landowners were not at the property owners meeting and on those segments that are identified as the most severely eroding. Those not present at the meeting will be contacted to allow access.
4.	The information identified in the survey will be compiled in a report to See-Kan RC&D that identifies those stream segments that need repaired and in what priority order based upon amount of sediment entering the stream and the cost of the project. The land use/condition of the riparian area would also be identified along with landowners along the stream.
5.	The report will also contain what projects can be completed under these categories
1.	vegetative
2.	structural
3.	combination of vegetative and structural
4.	establishment or enhancement of riparian areas

The local leadership team for the Verdigris WRAPS has requested that See-Kan RC&D administer and manage this grant application. 


Methods
Aerial Photography will be used to determine areas of stream segment that are actively eroding. The comparison between the old 1974 maps and the new digital photography should enable us to identify areas of actively eroding streams. That information will be used along with ownership maps to identify owners of property along the streams. Those owners will be invited to meetings to discuss their property and potential BMP’s that might be used to slow or mitigate the amount of soil that is leaving their property. 

The information gathered by the photography, physical surveys,  and owner meetings will by used to provide a report that will provide us with the information to focus our implementation plan. The hope is to expand this project to the south and also include into the Neosho Basin

A contractor or employee will be hired to complete the project with support from See-Kan RC&D. The Kansas Forest Service Watershed Forester will be involved with all phases of this project.

This project originated in Spring 2003 with grant funding provided by KDHE through Kansas Water Plan Funds to develop a WRAPS for the Fall River Watershed (HUC 11070102) and lower portion of the Upper Verdigris Watershed (HUC 11070101).  Services provided under this project included: technical assistance and overall project management provided the Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources & the Environment (KCARE); planning and facilitation support provided by K-State Research & Extension’s Office of Local Government; water quality monitoring support provided by K-State Dept. of Biological & Agricultural Engineering; and agricultural best management practices research provided by K-State Dept. of Animal Science.  Agencies supporting this project have included: County Extension offices; County Conservation Districts; NRCS; Kansas Rural Center; Flint Hills RC&D; SEE-KAN RC&D; Fall River Watershed District; KDHE Watershed Management Section; Kansas Water Office; and the Kansas Forest Service.

The WRAPS Development phase of this project was initiated in spring 2003 to engage stakeholders in the upper portion of the watershed (area above Fall River Reservoir).  WRAPS Development efforts for the lower portion of the watershed (including areas below Fall River and Toronto Reservoirs) was initiated in fall 2004.  Events and activities in both areas included watershed tours, public meetings, workshops, focus groups, as well as regular meetings of the local leadership team.  Local leadership teams were recruited to guide the development of these WRAPS projects, representing a highly collaborative effort between local watershed stakeholders and agency staff.  The Development phase provided an opportunity for watershed stakeholders to learn more about the WRAPS process, goals for the project, watershed conditions, and potential sources impacting water and other natural resources in the watershed.  These events & activities also provided opportunities for direct stakeholder input into the identification of local issues and concerns; development of watershed restoration and protection goals; identification of potential pollution sources; and identification of BMPs and other actions to achieve restoration & protection goals.

Concurrent with these stakeholder involvement efforts, three WRAPS Assessment projects were conducted in the upper portion of the Fall River watershed to better characterize watershed conditions and assess issues and concerns identified by watershed stakeholders.  A water quality monitoring study spanning 18 months was conducted to better understand the extent and sources of fecal coliform bacteria and other pollutants in the watershed.  Based on the results of this monitoring and input from local stakeholders, the leadership team was able to identify and immediately address an important source contributing significant bacteria pollution in the watershed.  A study to determine the “Effects of Headwater Impoundments on Intermittent Streams in the Flint Hills, Kansas” was conducted by the Kansas Department of Wildlife & Parks through internal funding.  The goal of this study was to determine what effects, if any, that watershed flood control impoundments have on downstream aquatic assemblages of macro-invertebrates, freshwater mussels, and fishes.  A Fluvial Geomorphology Report was also conducted by the Watershed Institute under contract with the Fall River Watershed District to examine the geomorphic effects of watershed impoundment structures on streams in the district.  Assessment activities were also initiated for the lower watersheds that included exploration of water quality impairments and other watershed issues and concerns by the local leadership team with assistance from agency staff.

The local leadership team in the upper Fall River, pending additional funding & technical support, is now prepared to initiate the Planning phase of this WRAPS project that will integrate the extensive stakeholder input and the findings of the monitoring studies.  Planning activities will include finalizing restoration & protection goals, identification of BMPs and other actions and an assessment of their associated pollutant load reduction capabilities, and the development of a strategy outlining specific actions or projects intended to implement the goals, agencies and stakeholders responsible for implementation, a timeline, and needs for funding & technical assistance.  The local leadership team in the lower Fall River, pending additional funding & technical support, is prepared to continue its Assessment activities and transition into the Planning phase.



Objectives
The goal of this project is to provide watershed leadership team support to 1) Fall River Lake Watershed 2) Lower Fall River  (area below Fall River to confluence with Verdigris River3) Verdigris River below Toronto Lake to Neodesha, and 3) assist in organizing additional leadership teams for Verdigris river from Neodesha to the state line.


Methods
The Office of Local Governement and the Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and the Environment at K-State Research & Extension will provide facilitation, education/outreach, and technical assistance in recruiting stakeholders to serve on leadership teams, assist in organizing and training leadership teams, organizing tours, workshops, facilitating leadership team meetings and preparing, assembling and maintaining WRAPS documents.

Fall River: Water Quality:In 1998, according to KDHE, nearly 25% of the stream/river segments monitored by KDHE had consistently experienced poor water quality and required the establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). KDHE reported that both fecal coliform bacteria and low dissolved oxygen impacted most of the upper reaches/tributaries of Fall River. The Fall River PMT established goals to reduce the bacteria.

These goals were accomplished by planning and installing a pilot solid waste management conservation practice at the two pollution sources within the city of Eureka, composting the solid waste to a usable organic material and then applying this organic material to a 5 acre brine scar in preparation for reseeding. 
The removal of the manure from the two sources resulted in a reduction of a fecal coliform population from 10,000 per 100 ml in a large runoff event to less than 1000 fecal bacteria population per 100 ml in similar runoff events.
Fall River: Information & Education: Numerous workshop, tours, and field days have been held in the 3 years of the Fall River WRAPS project. Subjects covered were; Nutrient management;  Quad County Water Festivals (approximately 300 3rd grade students attend each year); Brush management;  Pest management; Sprayer Calibration;  Range & Pond Management ;Koch Ranch Day; BMP Tours; Quarterly Newsletters; buffer brochures.

The water quality problems/issues vary in the Lower Republican, and Neosho river basins and the Middle Kansas, Lower Kansas, Lower Big Blue, Lower Little Blue, Delaware River and Fall River HUC 8’s that this project addresses in the 2nd year. Sedimentation, nutrient management, eutrophication and bacteria are the main water quality problems the project will address. Research has proven that forestland does a superior job compared to other cover types in reducing sediment entry into streams and rivers (Geyer, KSU,et. al. 2003) during flood events when the majority of sedimentation occurs. It is also recognized that sediment is often the carrier of nutrients and bacteria all of which contribute to eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs. Limiting livestock’s presence in riparian forests through fencing and offering alternative water supplies will reduce fecal coliform entry and sustain the health of the
forest. This project will use a combination of forestry technical services, education and promotion of forestry practices based upon the specific requests of WRAPS SLTs in targeted watersheds.  

Objectives
Goal 1 – Provide one-on-one contact with 47 landowners to offer forestry technical assistance to
prepare 18 plans to guide the implementation of 90 acres of forest stand improvement and the
establishment of 2,200 feet of riparian forest buffers in the Middle Kansas, Lower Kansas, Lower Big Blue, Lower Little Blue, Fall River and Delaware River HUC 8 watersheds. Implementing these forestry BMPs will provide an estimated pollutant load reduction of 223 lbs. of nitrogen, 110 lbs. of phosphorus and 68 tons of sediment in the respective watersheds.
Objective 1 - Services will be focused in areas where WRAPS assessments have identified that forestry BMPs will effectively improve or sustain water quality.
Objective 2 – Foresters will assist landowners in securing financial resources to implement forestry BMP’s through EQIP for Forestland Health, Continuous CRP and other pertinent programs. Objective 3 – Foresters will directly assist landowners with implementing forestry BMP’s by marking timber for forest stand improvement practices, laying out plantings and providing lists of forestry contractors for riparian tree planting and forest stand improvement.
Please describe each method needed to achieve the above goal and objectives. Include an approximate time frame for achieving each objective.

Goal 2 – Educate landowners in the Middle Kansas, Lower Kansas, Lower Big Blue, Lower Little Blue, Fall River and Delaware River HUC 8 watersheds regarding the important role of riparian forestland in sustaining water quality and public water supplies; and promote the adoption of forestry BMPs. A progress report will be provided at each SLT meeting.

The Flint Hills Resource Conservation and Development (FHRC&D) Area, Inc. has actively implemented water quality projects since 2000. The FHRC&D currently sponsors 5 Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) water quality projects in the; Marion, Twin Lakes, Clarks Creek, Melvern, and Fall River watersheds. In 2007 the FHRC&D, with KDHE approval began administrating and coordinating the implementation of these 5 projects. This allows the FHRC&D Water Quality Coordinators to work in concert to share their expertise in all 5 of the watersheds. 



This application will be for 2 years and includes each of the 5 watersheds listed above.  In addition, the Flint Hills RC&D will be submitting a separate application for 2 additional watersheds. Listed below are the past accomplishments and load reductions for each of the 5 watersheds included in this application.

Fall River: Water Quality:In 1998, according to KDHE, nearly 25% of the stream/river segments monitored by KDHE had consistently experienced poor water quality and required the establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). KDHE reported that both fecal coliform bacteria and low dissolved oxygen impacted most of the upper reaches/tributaries of Fall River. The Fall River PMT established goals to reduce the bacteria.

These goals were accomplished by planning and installing a pilot solid waste management conservation practice at the two pollution sources within the city of Eureka, composting the solid waste to a usable organic material and then applying this organic material to a 5 acre brine scar in preparation for reseeding. 
The removal of the manure from the two sources resulted in a reduction of a fecal coliform population from 10,000 per 100 ml in a large runoff event to less than 1000 fecal bacteria population per 100 ml in similar runoff events.
Fall River: Information & Education: Numerous workshop, tours, and field days have been held in the 3 years of the Fall River WRAPS project. Subjects covered were; Nutrient management;  Quad County Water Festivals (approximately 300 3rd grade students attend each year); Brush management;  Pest management; Sprayer Calibration;  Range & Pond Management ;Koch Ranch Day; BMP Tours; Quarterly Newsletters; buffer brochures.

"158","items",NA,"GA",64480,"OSDS Phase II","$325,000","Overview
Most of GA's coastal counties have limited public sewage treatment systems and rely on individual septic tank systems, known as Onsite Disposal Systems (OSDS), to handle human sewage production. Coastal development trends are causing increased installation of OSDS. Rapid increases in the number of septic tank systems can seriously affect the health of the caostal environment, as well as human health. The high water table and sandy soils in many areas of coastal GA are minimally suitable for OSDS installation. Local public health systems often lack the resources to conduct proper soil surveys in certain portions of the counties and improper systems are sometimes installed. In particularly rural or remote portions of the counties, many OSDS were installed before regulations were enacted and/or perhaps were installed in violation of regulated standards. Thus, most local governmnetal units have neither kept records of the number of OSDS in their jurisdictions nor their location. Current system installations are generally recorded in paper files and most do not have geo-referenced information.

Nonpoint source pollutions generally, and OSDS in particular, poses a major threat to water quality along the GA coast. Major sources of NPS can include storm drain runoff, wildlife, runoff of pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides from agricultural lands, residential lawns and golf courses, as well as fecal contamination from faulty OSDS. Fecal contimination of GA""s coastal waters is increasing. Of GA's 20 estuarine areas, 19 are cloased to shellfish harvesting (GDNR 1998). Ten of these areas are closed due to fecal contimination from NPS. Impacts of fecal contimination can force the closure of shellfish growing areas, curtailing oyster and clam harvesting and lead to the closure of clam farms and beachs designated for public swimming.

This project will continue efforts from the OSDS Phase I that have already built upon other Section 319(h) projects. More than 15 organizations and local governmental units will be participating partners in this effort. The project comes at an opportune time in the implementation of two major initiatives that address OSDS and wastewater, the Statewide Water Plan (and Councils) and the Coastal Comprehensive Plan.

Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:  1) prevent OSDS contimination of marshlands and surface waters through enhanced enforcement and compliance with public health rules and regulations and 2) produce and present a GIS project capable of identifying state waters most susceptible to impairment from NPS due to OSDS.

Methods
1) Train employees from county health offices to locate and provide GPS data on OSDS and private wells

2) Obtain through offical local records, addresses for residential and business properties located a pre-determined distance from marshlands or other waters

3) A minimum of 4 meetings between county healh department officials, MAREX and County Board of Commissioners to explain the goals of the project

4) Conduct a survey of OSDS and well locations within a 90' proximity to marshlands or other state waters in Camden, Chatham, Glynn and McIntosh counties

5) Transfer collected information to WELSTROM database

6) Compel OSDS enforcement and compliance by inspecting the condition of all systems with 90' to the surface waters

7) Cretate GIS maps and analyses of OSDS and wells

8) Produce pollution susceptibility profile/index of coastal waters developed through a workgroup process representing scientists, policy makers, coastal resource managers, local field staff and GIS professionals
 
9) Present the findings of the survey and the OSDS susceptibility index to local governments and local health departments

The Siuslaw Watershed Council (SWC) will develop, manage, and collaborate on TMDL development in the Siuslaw Watershed and Coastal Lakes area on the Oregon Coast.  Siuslaw streams are on the 303(d) List for temperature, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform, sediment, and biological and habitat criteria.  In cooperation with the TMDL development program for the Mid Coast Basin in 2005, the SWC facilitated the mainstem Siuslaw temperature modeling study through the Lincoln SWCD.  
Through this project, SWC will continue collaborative efforts and direct management of TMDL development of other water quality parameters, and will undertake a temperature study of Lake Creek, a Siuslaw tributary that drains approximately one-third of the basin.  This project will provide data management for direct integration into the Mid Coast Basin TMDL database managed by Lincoln SWCD and the Siletz Tribe (maintained in accordance with LIMS, LASAR, and STORET protocols).  This project will provide for the completion of data collection associated with ongoing Mid Coast TMDL studies, implement new phases of data collection, and develop the QAPP and project management for remaining parameters of interest.
Ultimately this project will lead to the development of TMDLs for the Siuslaw Watershed and Mid Coast Basin ahead of the 2008 schedule set by DEQ.  The data gathered and applied to watershed knowledge will help identify land use issues and restoration site opportunities for project development with land managers to help improve water quality.

In 2005, various watershed monitoring groups under the direction of DEQ and Lincoln SWCD staff, collected data to be used for the development of temperature TMDLs for 303(d) listed streams in the Mid Coast Basin.  This project will continue using this organizational structure to prepare quality assurance project plans and coordinate collection, analysis, and assembly of data for the development of bacteria and dissolved oxygen TMDLs.  This project will also recover data collected over many years of local watershed councils’ monitoring efforts, review the data and prepare qualified data for entry into LIMS, LASAR, NW Regional Data Exchange and STORET.  In addition, this project will provide technical and financial assistance to landowners to correct conditions limiting water quality as identified through this project. 

Objectives
(1)  Local coordination by Lincoln Soil and Water Conservation District of the development and implementation of monitoring projects for TMDL development in the Mid Coast Basin.
   (2)  Develop quality assurance project plans (QAPP) for collecting and analyzing data related to bacteria and dissolved oxygen.
   (3)  Expand data management capability for entering all water quality data in the Mid Coast Basin into EPA/DEQ shared databases through subcontract with Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.
   (4)  Identify all water quality data collection efforts over the past 10 years and assemble the qualified data for inclusion in EPA/DEQ databases.
   (5)  Subcontract with local individuals and groups to collect and analyze data necessary to develop TMDLs for bacteria and dissolved oxygen.
   (6)  Determine spatial and temporal extent of bacteria and dissolved oxygen water quality limiting conditions and confirm “hot spots” for more intensive monitoring.
   (7)  Provide means to assist landowners in correcting significant water quality limiting conditions identified through the analysis of monitoring results. 
   (8)  Implement best management practices (BMPs) to address sources of nutrients including barnyard runoff management, waste storage/composting facilities, remove stream access for livestock by installing off-stream watering systems, livestock heavy use area protection, and home sewage treatment system repair. 
   (9)  Conduct annual visits to sites where BMPs were implemented to evaluate effectiveness of the applied practices.

"165","items",NA,"OR",89710,"Siuslaw Riparian Restoration and WQ Monitoring","$15,524","Overview
The Siuslaw Watershed has experienced significant declines
in salmonid production and degradation to water quality from historic levels. The
implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) is necessary to improve riparian
conditions and reduce non-point source pollution in order to address these declines. Currently,
riparian restoration efforts are being implemented throughout the basin through various
individual restoration projects and the Siuslaw Watershed Council’s (SWC) Riparian Restoration
/ Native Plant Distribution program.

Objectives
We are proposing to use funding from this grant to
increase the intensity and breadth of these on-going projects in the basin by focusing riparian
restoration efforts in the areas mentioned above which have 303d listings and are identified as
suffering from poor water quality conditions by the SWC Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring
Program (VWQMP). Funding is also being sought to expand and improve the SWC’s water
quality monitoring capability through the purchase of a continuous temperature/conductivity
logger.

Methods
The logger will initially be used to monitor water quality in the upper mainstem Siuslaw
near the town of Lorane, an area that our VWQMP has identified as not meeting water quality
standards for temperature, dissolved oxygen and bacteria and experiencing high year-round
turbidity levels. This logger will allow us to better answer the following questions related to
water quality assessment in the upper mainstem sub-basin: 1.) What is the temperature regime
of the upper basin and how often are temperature maximums exceeding DEQ standards? 2.) Are
the high levels of turbidity in this area paralleled by high levels of conductivity, indicating
potential impacts to water quality through high concentrations of anthropogenic sources of
dissolved solids? Once the SWC has been able to better answer these questions with the new
equipment, we will target other areas for temperature and conductivity monitoring using the
new logger.","N","Project Implementation","17100206","171002060302","N","05/06/2014","On Schedule","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:89710"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,15524

Full-time conservation technicians were established through funding provided by EPA 319 and the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The positions are needed to provide continued technical assistance to local citizens to implement the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico TMDLs and compile yearly-required reports. Providing additional technical assistance is desirable for natural resource conservation planning, landowner education on NPS pollutants, and the design, installation, and maintenance of agricultural best management practices and stormwater controls to achieve the desired nutrient loading goals in all three watersheds.

NC DWQ recognizes the need for conservation technicians in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins for assisting residents to implement and maintain nutrient reductions. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation will work cooperatively with each of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (districts), the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other state and federal partners to ensure success. Conservation technicians are county employees with offices located in local SWCD offices.  Specific duties of each conservation technician include outreach to residents, education, and installation and maintenance of agricultural and urban best management practices.
Watershed technician positions are needed in districts in order to assure consistent reporting for the agricultural rules in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  During the course of this project, the number of technicians employed in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins has been reduced to insure efficient use of funding, while still being able to provide valuable technical assistance and complete annual reporting activities. Where position technicians were not able to obtain additional local or state funding, districts have entered in contracts to receive small annual payments that are less expensive than the cost of a full-time technician, but still provide reporting assistance to the Local Advisories Committees.  

It is important to note that the agricultural rule strategies depend upon local advisory committees to complete annual reporting requirements to insure compliance and report progress with the goals of the rule.  The funding requested in this grant will allow for a coordinated system of annual reporting and focus on rule implementation, as there were no funds provided for local staff positions to assist in rule implementation.  These staff positions and contracts allow the State to receive consistent information from each county.  Although the local advisory committee members are appointed, they serve as volunteers.  Without local staff coordination, obtaining the most up-to-date and accurate information from 30 counties would be infeasible.  

The primary objective of this project is to employ fulltime conservation technicians to provide technical assistance to local citizens and landowners in natural resource conservation planning and best management practice (BMP) implementation to help meet the Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) strategies in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  Accelerated technical assistance is beneficial for natural resource conservation planning and BMP design, installation, and maintenance.  Having staff available locally to do this important work has helped agricultural operations achieve their nutrient reduction goals collectively in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  
 
The Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and the USDA-NRCS staff provide technical information, engineering assistance, and oversight of BMP installation.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation (DSWC) works with the districts using the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program (ACSP) infrastructure to provide SWCDs with matching salary funds for these technicians and for BMP contracts in these river basins.  

In December 1997, the EMC adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy (15A NCAC 2B.0238).  For the first time in state history, river basin rules were applied to agricultural nonpoint sources. The strategy is aimed at reducing the nitrogen load to the Neuse River Estuary from agricultural nonpoint sources by a minimum of 30 percent of the average annual load from the period 1991-1995 by August 2003.  The nitrogen reduction goal and management measures stated in the strategy also are mirrored in the TMDL for the Neuse Estuary.  The TMDL was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 2001.  The TMDL calls for continuing to implement the Neuse NSW Management Strategy.

A total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Pamlico Estuary was approved in 1995 based on a two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic model of the estuary from Greenville to Pamlico Point. The TMDL requires a 30% reduction in total nitrogen and no net increase in total phosphorus loading from the 1991 baseline year (DEM 1994). Since 1991, a voluntary program for agricultural nitrogen reduction has been underway resulting in approximately one-third of the cropland treated with nutrient reducing best management practices. In 1998, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) determined that agriculture had not made sufficient progress toward implementation of the TMDL and nutrient reduction targets. After a rulemaking process involving stakeholders and a legislative negotiation, Session Law 2001-355 was passed in 2001. The agricultural nutrient control strategy for the Tar-Pamlico was adopted by the EMC as 15A NCAC 2B .0256.  The session law and the rule require agricultural nutrient reductions according to the TMDL by September 1, 2006.  

Another important role of the watershed technician is implementing community conservation practices, and providing technical assistance and educational opportunities for all ages.  The technicians will be capable of designing and supervising the installation of basic stormwater BMPs such as grass swales, rain gardens, and stormwater wetland projects.  They will also have the opportunity to educate landowners, homeowner associations and school-aged children on the sources and effects of NPS pollution.   

The long-term objective of this proposal is to actively engage the technicians with local governments and Soil and Water Conservation Districts in addressing their nonpoint source pollution concerns.  Through education and outreach programs as well as technical assistance to all landowners, these technicians should become a vital asset to the counties they serve.  Demonstrating these technicians’ attributes to their host County will be a crucial element in achieving the local governments continual funding of the position.   There are some counties that have not been able to support a technician based on the limited funding available through the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program.  For those counties, we will enter into a service contract to insure that the nutrient strategy work is done and that each county is promoting nutrient management practices.  These contracts will allow all necessary data to be compiled for the required annual report at a lesser cost than hiring a full time technician.


Objectives
The local river basin technicians (319 currently supports 6 of the 7 positions depicted below) will be instrumental in working with citizens to learn more about nutrient reduction and encourage additional installation of best management practices. The three main categories of work they will do include: 
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.
2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies.
3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

 

These staff positions will have additional responsibilities, as described below:

	Coordinate efforts with other agency personnel to work in accordance with the Local Nutrient Reduction Strategy developed by LACs for the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.
	Implement the local strategy for the counties they serve and address incomplete items and conditional actions. 
	Complete NLEW runs for the annual report, spreadsheets for BMPs installed, and update local strategies each May. For strategies below the goal, develop and implement a plan for achieving goals. 
	Organize and participate in LAC meetings in coordination with LAC chair and district staff. 
	Document nutrient reducing BMPs. 
	Attend many of the Soil and Water Conservation District meetings and County Planning Meetings, where applicable, in each county to keep them informed of progress towards the nutrient reduction goals. 
	Work effectively with landowners, farmers and contractors in the installation of best management practices.
	Attend training provided through NRCS and others to learn how to install and plan nutrient reducing BMPs, complete the necessary training to become a Certified Nutrient Management Planner, and work towards becoming a Certified Conservation Planner. 
	Provide technical assistance to landowners to implement community conservation practices on their properties.
	Conduct outreach and environmental education programs.
	Contact landowners to advise them of regulatory requirements in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, options for complying with requirements, and opportunities available to assist in installation of nutrient reduction practices. 
	Collect information necessary to develop individual conservation farm plans for nutrient reduction in accordance with local, state and federal rules and policy, using standards and specifications of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Natural Resources Conservation Service or those adopted by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  
	Work with the District Conservationist or department head and other staff members to complete farm plans and write nutrient management plans.
	Incorporate existing and new federal and state cost share assistance programs in planning for best management practice implementation.  Assist with writing contracts and BMP planning with guidance of District Conservationist or department head.         
	Prepare necessary records and quarterly reports on work accomplished; maintain field office records and case files as required. 

Watershed Technicians have a significant role in conservation planning, developing cost share contracts, and writing nutrient management plans.  The role of technicians working with farmers to plan and install BMPs has increased due to limiting staffing and significant conservation funding.  The watershed technicians have been instrumental in accelerating BMP design and installation since they have been employed.  When looking at data since the baseline periods of the three strategies, the State’s Agriculture Cost Share Program has provided substantial support for BMP implementation.  Since 1992, a total of $24,099,930 has been spent through the NC Agricultural Cost Share program in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  This has resulted in 338,745 acres affected by BMPs, 4,900,138 pounds of N saved, 1,159,653 pounds of P saved and 1,157,774 tons of soil saved. The need for continued focus and BMP implementation in these basins is justified by the water quality monitoring data the state collects, which still indicates impairment.  


Methods
The measurable results of this project will be acres affected by BMPs, the tons of soil saved, and the pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus saved through the NC Agricultural Cost Share Program. Many of the farmers in the three watersheds participate in state and federal cost share programs.  All cost share programs require a landowner contribution to receive state or federal assistance, and many farmers install best management practices without government assistance. 

Since 1992, a total of $24,099,930 has been spent through the NC Agricultural Cost Share program in the Neuse & Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

The number of BMPs installed and the number of landowners participating in the project will measure the success of this project.  

An additional measurable result will be receiving the yearly annual reporting data from each local advisory committee so that each Basinwide annual report can be compiled
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.

2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies. This includes the annual county reports produced by technicians that when compiled for the basin or watershed, provide a comprehensive summary of estimated nitrogen losses from cropland based on the Nutrient Loss Estimation Worksheet. Reports show progress by county toward achieving the 30% nitrogen reduction goal for both the Neuse and the Tar-Pamlico. In counties where the goal has already been achieved, technicians will track continued compliance and maintenance of the goal. Where progress is below goal expectations, technicians will work with farmers and agency representatives to determine likely opportunities for reductions and target technical and cost-share assistance where needed.

3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

In December 1997, the Environmental Management Commission (EMC) adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy.  For the first time in state history, mandatory controls were applied not only on point source pollution, but also on nonpoint source pollution in the Neuse River basin. The strategy has eight rules that affect both urban and rural areas.  The strategy is aimed at reducing the average annual load of nitrogen delivered to the Neuse River Estuary from point and nonpoint source pollution by a minimum of 30% of the average annual load from the period 1991 through 1995 by the year 2003.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation has been heavily involved in the implementation and reporting of the agriculture rule.  

The Neuse agricultural rule provides each farmer with the option of becoming part of a collective local strategy for implementing BMPs or implementing standard BMPs as specified in the rule.  A Basin Oversight Committee and seventeen Local Advisory Committees were established to implement the Neuse agricultural rule and to assist farmers with complying with the rule.

The Falls Lake Reservoir encompasses the upper part of the Neuse River Basin.  Despite the regulatory nutrient management strategy in the Neuse River Basin, the Falls Lake Reservoir's water quality has continued to decline, and portions of the lake are now impaired for chorophyll-a and turbidity.  To address this water quality problem, additional water quality monitoring and modeling are underway as North Carolina prepares a total maximum daily load and plans to initiate a rule making process.  Since additional rules will impact the Falls Lake Watershed, it will be important for this position to assist the Division of Water Quality and the local soil and water conservation districts as the state develops a revised agricultural rule for this part of the Neuse River Basin.

In 2000, the Environmental Management Commission moved the nonpoint source side of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to a regulatory approach with the adoption of rules addressing agriculture, urban stormwater, nutrient management, and riparian buffer protection.  This rulemaking built on the precedent-setting Neuse effort three years earlier, which for the first time set regulatory reduction measures for nutrients on cropland acres in the state.  The agriculture rule supports the overall goals of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to reduce nitrogen loading to the Pamlico estuary by 30% from 1991 levels and to limit phosphorus loading to 1991 levels.

In addition, the EMC approved an innovative nutrient reduction strategy involving trading of pollution reduction credits between point and nonpoint sources.  In general, point sources can fulfill their nutrient reduction requirements using the most cost-effective method, including the option of funding implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs).

The main responsibility of the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Basin Coordinator is to facilitate nutrient load reduction from agricultural enterprises in order to meet the goal established in both the Neuse, Falls Lake (when adopted) and Tar-Pamlico agricultural rules.  In addition to helping local entities meet these goals, this position will be responsible for developing the annual agriculture reports for the EMC that are required by the rules.  This individual will also work closely with the NC Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), EPA, the Division of Water Quality (DWQ), and other divisions within the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) to promote and implement water quality efforts in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

In December 1997, the Environmental Management Commission (EMC) adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy.  For the first time in state history, mandatory controls were applied not only on point source pollution, but also on nonpoint source pollution in the Neuse River basin. The strategy has eight rules that affect both urban and rural areas.  The strategy is aimed at reducing the average annual load of nitrogen delivered to the Neuse River Estuary from point and nonpoint source pollution by a minimum of 30% of the average annual load from the period 1991 through 1995 by the year 2003.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation has been heavily involved in the implementation and reporting of the agriculture rule.  

The Neuse agricultural rule provides each farmer with the option of becoming part of a collective local strategy for implementing BMPs or implementing standard BMPs as specified in the rule.  A Basin Oversight Committee and seventeen Local Advisory Committees were established to implement the Neuse agricultural rule and to assist farmers with complying with the rule.

The Falls Lake Reservoir encompasses the upper part of the Neuse River Basin.  Despite the regulatory nutrient management strategy in the Neuse River Basin, the Falls Lake Reservoir's water quality has continued to decline, and portions of the lake are now impaired for chorophyll-a and turbidity.  To address this water quality problem, additional water quality monitoring and modeling are underway as North Carolina prepares a total maximum daily load and plans to initiate a rule making process.  Since additional rules will impact the Falls Lake Watershed, it will be important for this position to assist the Division of Water Quality and the local soil and water conservation districts as the state develops a revised agricultural rule for this part of the Neuse River Basin.

In 2000, the Environmental Management Commission moved the nonpoint source side of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to a regulatory approach with the adoption of rules addressing agriculture, urban stormwater, nutrient management, and riparian buffer protection.  This rulemaking built on the precedent-setting Neuse effort three years earlier, which for the first time set regulatory reduction measures for nutrients on cropland acres in the state.  The agriculture rule supports the overall goals of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to reduce nitrogen loading to the Pamlico estuary by 30% from 1991 levels and to limit phosphorus loading to 1991 levels.

In addition, the EMC approved an innovative nutrient reduction strategy involving trading of pollution reduction credits between point and nonpoint sources.  In general, point sources can fulfill their nutrient reduction requirements using the most cost-effective method, including the option of funding implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs).

The main responsibility of the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Basin Coordinator is to facilitate nutrient load reduction from agricultural enterprises in order to meet the goal established in both the Neuse, Falls Lake (when adopted) and Tar-Pamlico agricultural rules.  In addition to helping local entities meet these goals, this position will be responsible for developing the annual agriculture reports for the EMC that are required by the rules.  This individual will also work closely with the NC Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), EPA, the Division of Water Quality (DWQ), and other divisions within the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) to promote and implement water quality efforts in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

Nitrogen (N) over-enrichment in North Carolina’s river basins leads to accelerated eutrophication in downstream estuaries, exemplified as nuisance phytoplankton blooms in the N-sensitive waters of the lower Neuse River Estuary (NRE).  N-stimulated blooms in the Neuse and other NC estuaries results in reduced water clarity, food web disruption-toxicity, and oxygen depletion, with negative impacts on finfish and shellfish habitat and health and overall loss of aesthetics. Concern about N-over-enrichment was the basis for a 30% reduction in total N (TN) loading (TMDL) to the NRE at New Bern, NC (based on mean 1990-1995 N loadings; 15A NCAC 2B .0232).  While nitrate-N inputs have been reduced in the NRE’s catchment, the Neuse River Basin (NRB), total N (TN) loads remain well above the mandated 30% reduction that was to occur since 2000. The reason the 30% reduction has not been met appears to be due to organic N, which has increased steadily in the NRB over the last 15 years. The goal of this proposed project is to create a tool that improves the accountability of N sources in the Neuse River Basin (NRB) and its estuary. This tool is called “FluorMod” – a model which quantifies the loads of potentially “restorable” non-point sources of organic N that have increased in the NRB despite nutrient reduction strategies.  FluorMod, coupled to bioassays aimed at determining the bioreactivity of organic N sources, will provide the basis and rationale for implementing reductions or elimination of these N sources in the Neuse River Basin. We will test the hypothesis that organic N is biologically reactive for phytoplankton and has become an increasingly important form of N which is impairing water quality in the NRB and maintaining N loads exceeding the TMDL and the mandated 30% reduction in N overall. We provide a combined approach of field sampling, laboratory analyses, and bioassays that will result in the production of geospatial maps of organic-N loads to the NRB and their corresponding biological reactivity, assessed as phytoplankton production (chlorophyll a), in the NRE. While being developed for the NRB, this model will be applicable in any river-estuary basin.

Objectives
As the third largest river basin in North Carolina, the Neuse River Basin (NRB) includes 5470 km of freshwater streams, 230 km of saltwater streams, and 150,000 hectares of brackish to saltwater estuary. A significant percentage of the freshwater and estuarine streams in the basin are impaired due to elevated turbidity, low biological integrity, excessive chlorophyll a concentrations and low dissolved oxygen content (Deamer, 2009).  One of the main causes of these deleterious conditions is nutrient pollution, specifically nitrogen (N) over-enrichment, leading to accelerated eutrophication, exemplified as phytoplankton blooms in downstream N-sensitive waters of the lower river and estuary.  N-stimulated blooms in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE) and other NC estuaries results in reduced water clarity, food web disruption-toxicity, and oxygen depletion, with negative impacts on finfish and shellfish habitat and health and overall loss of aesthetics (e.g. fish kills; Boesch et al. 2001; Cloern et al. 2001 and oxygen depletion: Findlay and Sinsabaugh, 1999). The goal of this proposed project is to create a tool that improves the accountability of N sources in the NRB and its estuary. This tool is a model which quantifies the loads of potentially “restorable” non-point sources of organic N that have increased in the NRB despite nutrient reductions strategies and which determines if it is practical and useful to reduce or eliminate those sources. We will test the hypothesis that organic N is biologically reactive for phytoplankton and has become an increasingly important form of N which is impairing water quality in the NRB and maintaining N loads exceeding the TMDL and the mandated 30% reduction in N overall. We provide a combined approach of field sampling, laboratory analyses, and microcosm bioassays that will result in the production of geospatial maps of organic-N loads to the NRB and their corresponding biological reactivity, assessed as phytoplankton production (chlorophyll a), in the NRE. While being developed for the NRB, this model will be applicable in any river-estuary basin.
In the NRB, urbanization and intensive agriculture (e.g., confined animal feeding operations, CAFOs) are growing land uses that have increased runoff and stream-based nutrient export (Deamer et al. 2009).  In coastal watersheds such as the NRB which feeds into the NRE, this has important (and poorly quantified) implications for the function of estuarine ecosystems, from which humans derive a variety of ecosystems services (seafood production, transport and recreation, aesthetics).  Conversion of lands from wetland/forest to urban/agriculture modifies DOM quality in streams (Williams et al. 2010; Wilson and Xenopoulos 2009), and this increase in organic matter (especially organic-N) loads is exacerbated by a recent rise in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (Webster et al. 2005; Paerl et al. 2006; Elsner et al. 2008; Paerl 2010). Quantifying the sources and loads of N, in terms of their seasonal and inter-annual variability, is a key goal of managing North Carolina’s estuarine and coastal water quality.  
The Neuse River Basin Water Quality Plan identifies nonpoint source (NPS) runoff from a variety of land use practices as the primary source of nutrients impacting surface water quality in the basin (NCDENR 2004; Deamer, 2009; NCDENR 2009a). Despite the implementation of nutrient (N) reduction strategies (i.e. N-based TMDL; NCDENR 2009a,b), total nitrogen (TN) loads to the NRE do not appear to have significantly decreased over the past decade (Lebo et al. 2009; under review).  Within the TN pool, inputs of the dominant inorganic form of N, nitrate (NO3), have decreased, particularly in the upper Neuse Basin.  However, the organic fraction of TN has increased throughout the Basin, with the net effect being no detectable reduction of TN (Lebo et al. 2009, under review). Of parallel concern are the observations that periodic exceedances of the 40 μg L-1 chlorophyll a (Chl a) water quality standard continue (NC DENR 2009a; Paerl et al., 2009, 2010), and therefore the NRE remains nutrient impaired. As such, the specific goal of a 30 % reduction in TN loading near the entrance to the NRE and the reduction of Chl a standard violations within the NRE have not yet been achieved (NC DENR, 2010). Reductions in N inputs may take time to detect in measured loading, due to year-to-year variability in precipitation, flow, and temporally delayed ground water inputs. Based on the results of recent trend analysis, however, it is evident that it will take more than five years to discern a 30 percent decrease in load to the estuary (Lebo et al. 2009, under review).
In order to resolve and appropriately address the issue of why the TMDL of N is not being met, several key pieces of information are needed: 1) What are the sources of the organic N fraction of TN that continues to increase in the NRB?; 2) What proportion of TN loading is organic N and how much will this fraction need to be reduced to meet the TMDL total N loading requirements?; and, 3) What proportion of the organic N fraction is available to the phytoplankton and hence driving current Chl a exceedances?
This project will provide critical information about organic N and make it actionable by North Carolina regulators and stakeholders to modify as needed N reduction strategies for the NRB and elsewhere. To achieve the project’s goal, three key objectives are proposed:
1)	Calculate DON and PON loads to the NRB attributable to key sources.
a.	Apply a cost-effective and easy to use model (hereafter, “FluorMod”) to determine the sources of DON and PON to the NRB;
b.	Calibrate FluorMod so that it computes DON and PON concentrations of a given water sample;
c.	Integrate USGS flow data into FluorMod to calculate DON and PON loads to the NRB.
2)	Determine seasonal variability in organic N load to the NRB by source as a function of flow and regional climate/weather patterns (e.g., storms and droughts).
a.	Quantify DON and PON concentrations and sources in a GIS model
b.	Produce organic N load maps as layers viewable via GIS software
3)	Determine the bioavailability of organic N (primarily DON) to phytoplankton, establishing a nutrient response variable (Chl a) for organic N.
	This goal and these objectives will be met by a combination of an observational program, laboratory and field-based analyses, and modeling, conducted over a three year period to capture the seasonal and inter-annual variability in hydrology (stream flow) within the NRB.


Methods
Dissolved N species in surface waters occur in three forms (ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) ions, and organic compounds (DON)) that are potentially bioreactive, meaning they are used as nutrients by phytoplankton. Excessive N loading stimulates phytoplankton production, resulting in eutrophication (i.e. Chl a exceedances) and harmful algal bloom formation in the NRE (Rudek et al. 1991; Christian et al. 1991; Paerl et al. 1995; 2004; 2007, 2010: Burkholder et al. 2004). 
Figure 1 shows N loading trends measured at Kinston, NC, during the past 30 years (Lebo et al. 2009, in review). A clear reduction in NO3-, well below the 30% reduction mandated by the TMDL, coupled with a relative increase in TKN: the sum of NH4+ and organic N (ON) is observed. Historically, nitrate has been the focus of nutrient reduction strategies, as this form of N is a key plant nutrient. Ammonium is rapidly oxidized to NO2-/NO3- in river water at pH and D.O. values found in the NRB (though exceptions in some tributaries exist). However, NH4+ concentrations have remained relatively stable in the Neuse River (Lebo et al. 2009, in review). Figure 1 indicates that organic-N is the key component that is maintaining the increase in TKN and, hence, TN.  The increase began in 2000, when rapid growth within the greater Raleigh-Durham region of Wake County took place.  The success of nitrate reduction strategies is evident through 2010. What is disconcerting about Figure 1 is the gradual increase in Total N (TN); this trend clearly coincides with the increase in TKN loads. Thus, despite a key reduction in nitrate-N below the 30% threshold, relative TN loads continue to rise and are well above this threshold.

Goal: Technical assistance and implementation support of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, streambank and shoreline erosion control to limit nutrients and sediment in runoff from urban lands.  

Introduction: The Virginia Stormwater Management Act of 2004, consolidated Virginia's stormwater management programs within the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and transferred oversight responsibilities to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board from the Board of Conservation and Recreation. This legislation has had a significant impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s stormwater management capability.  

Description: DEQ may provide funding and support in the form of sub-recipient agreements, training and technical assistance to local governments to help them adopt local stormwater ordinances or establish a comprehensive local stormwater program in the localities that currently do not have programs. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by DCR and contractual partners. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the local adoption of stormwater programs during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities.  Funds may also be used to provide professional training to localities in the development of their local programs, ordinance development, education and outreach, etc.

Results will include required corrective actions of reviewed local programs to gain compliance with state laws. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by these positions. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the program during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities. Staff will be involved in local projects as needed and as assigned by regional office or program management to address situational issues or to provide design recommendations. 


Objectives
Funding Use: State Water Quality Improvement Fund and Water Quality Improvement Reserve funds will be be used to provide sub-recipient agreements to localities. These funds will provide technical assistance to localities in the implementation of the Stormwater Management Law and Regulations and the Construction and Development elements of the Nonpoint Source Management Program.  These funds will not be used to directly fund elements of VPDES (Phase I or Phase II) or NPDES activities except for as allowed in the 319H program guidance. As stated “Section 319H nonpoint source control funds may not be used to implement specific requirements of draft or final stormwater permits or to implement permit application requirements.  These funds will only be used to fund the following eligible activities related to urban stormwater runoff (Federal Register, Vol. 68, No. 204, #60665),
•	Technical assistance to local stormwater programs;
•	Best management practices for pollution prevention and runoff control, except for BMPS required by a draft or final VPDES/NPDES permit;
•	Information and education programs;
•	Technology transfer and training; and
•	Development and implementation of regulations, policies and local ordinances to address stormwater runoff. These may apply to areas covered by NPDES permits, provided that the regulations, policies and ordinances apply to non-permitted areas as well.


Methods
Responsibilities and activities: 
•	Provide technical assistance and guidelines for the implementation of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control and stormwater management.
•	Ordinance development – particularly for the localities that do not currently have any stormwater program  
•	Funding and Staffing plan development – the Integration Bill requires localities to develop these plans as part of their overall local stormwater program development
•	Development of administrative tools such as checklists, policies, maintenance agreements

Goal: To work as a team member in a regional setting and within the Division of Soil and Water Conservation to provide professional assistance to Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) to achieve mutual goals and improve water quality. To provide leadership and program direct to SWCDs and to implement DSWC nonpoint source reduction programs through SWCDs within the region. 

Introduction: This project will provide funding to support three fulltime (FTE) DCR employees to serve as Conservation District Coordinators in three regional offices throughout Virginia (Abingdon, Christiansburg and Suffolk) to provide leadership and technical assistance to Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs). Soil and water conservation districts (SWCDs) were established in the 1930s to develop comprehensive programs and plans to conserve soil resources, control and prevent soil erosion, prevent floods and conserve, develop, utilize and dispose water. Today, forty-seven districts serve as local resources for citizens in nearly all Virginia localities.



Objectives
Description: The Conservation District Coordinator (CDC) is directly responsible for communication with all assigned SWCDs who are elected and appointed officials.  Routinely communicates and interacts with other state and federal conservation oriented agencies including but not limited to:  USDA-NRCS, FSA, Army Corps of Engineers, USFWS, VCE, VDOF, VOF, VDEQ, and VDGIF.  Additionally, the CDC is involved with local watershed roundtables, coalitions or other citizen based organizations.  Within routine activities, the CDC occasionally communicates with state legislators, members of the Soil and Water Conservation Board, members of the Virginia Association of SWCDs, and the National Association of SWCDs. The CDC is expected to advise SWCD on operating an elected board of officials as a public body, which includes assistance with personnel management, fiscal operations, and interpreting state program policy.  Additionally, the CDC must advise SWCDs on the Freedom of Information Act, give advice on appropriate board actions including budgetary decisions and meeting minutes, avoiding conflict of interest, and provide training.  Any SWCD action which may result in complications must be shared with the Regional Manager.  SWCD allocations, funding realignments, or SWCD actions that have regional implications must also be communicated to the Regional Manager.

Methods
Outputs:
Attend no less than 50% of assigned SWCD meetings so that state programs are conveyed positively, issues are resolved locally;
Coordinate submission of the Clean Water Farm Awards by 11/1/2016;
Coordinate selection of one (or more) Grand Basin winners; prepare for award ceremonies at appropriate meetings;
Encourage enhanced leadership and capacity of SWCD directors and staff; by 3/31/2017;
Coordinate and deliver a multi-agency orientation program for new SWCD directors and employees;
Conduct SWCD compliance and work audit annually.","N","Project Implementation","03010201","030102010703","N","01/01/2016","Accepted by EPA","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:98023"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>","N",NA,NA,218400

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.
DEQ will enter into a interagency pass-thru agreement with DCR to administer this objective. DCR will manage FTEs, procure goods/services and develop sub-recipient agreements for this work.
Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce NPS of both surface and groundwater. The mission of the NM (NM) program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters. DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources to improve efficient nutrient uptake by plants, which minimizes loss to the environment, thus protecting
the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. NM specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers and develop site-specific NM plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields.

Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) NPS Program funding will be used to support the NM Program Manager and the NM Training and Certification Coordinator both based in the DCR central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 NM Specialists who will be housed in agency field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement all NM (NM) and urban NM (UN) milestone goals in the Virginia NPS Pollution Management Program Plan. In addition this Objective implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan. Restriction of Funding: As directed by Federal grant
guidance, these positions will not be directly or indirectly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES/VPDES program responsibilities or activities (including writing plans in order to write, obtain, implement or adhere to a point source discharge permit). This includes working in any capacity with impacted CAFOs (those with or applying for NPDES/VPDES permits).
Program Income: It is not anticipated that any program income will be generated from this Objective. The Section 319(h) program only pays for the training coordinator; any costs related to holding the trainings are paid for by sources other than 319. If any fees or funds are generated through the certification and/or training programs these will be exclusively utilized for program activities and reported to EPA at the end of the grant cycle. This is a requirement in State regulation that all money generated from NM training be used for the trainings. If program
income is generated this will be reported to Virginia’s EPA Project Officer and will be identified to EPA on the Interim and Final FFR.

"201","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The Cache River Watershed, listed as impaired due to turbidity and total dissolved solids is a watershed of enormous environmental and economic significance and steps must be taken to ensure its continued use.

Tasks for ASU Ecotoxicology Research Facility (ERF) include the following water quality parameters:
1.	Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
2.	Turbidity
3.	Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
4.	pH
5.	Nitrates
6.	Nitrites
7.	Orthophosphate
8.	Total Nitrogen
9.	Total Phosphorus
These parameters will be collected by ASU personnel and tested on all samples delivered to the ERF.  All WQ parameters will be tested according to APHA protocol as stated in the QAPP.  Sampling protocol is described below:

Monitoring data is to be collected near HUC 12 outlets of Cache River watershed, including three existing USGS stage and discharge monitoring stations.  These 20 sites will be sampled monthly over a three year period on a fixed interval (n=240 samples)(see Appendix 1003 for list of subwatersheds); additional water samples will be collected annually across a range of flows including storm events at the three existing USGS sites (n=36 samples).  A total of 276 samples are required to be collected during each year of the project period.  The routine, monthly sampling will be used to understand how physicochemical properties change in relation to the mix of catchment land use, whereas the supplemental water samples across the range of flow conditions will be used to estimate constituent loads at the select sites.  Data will be made available to Dr. Dharmendra Saraswat for watershed modeling.  Water samples are required to be collected from the vertical centroid of flow, where the water is actively flowing and well mixed, using an Alpha style horizontal sampler or Kemmerer type vertical sampler; routine, monthly plus the supplemental water samples also need to be collected in this fashion.  In the event water flow is completely absent from a site, sampling will be postponed until sufficient flow is present for sampling.

These watersheds will be sampled to demonstrate effectiveness of conservation implementation resulting from an MRBI grant initiated in the Middle Cache River Watershed and will be used for watershed modeling. These test results will be used to measure effectiveness of implemented management practices and WQ improvement following implementation and used for SWAT modeling input.


Objectives
The primary objective is to measure the effectiveness of the BMPs associated with the Mississippi River Basin Initiatives (MRBI) via water quality parameter measures (Total Suspended Solids, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Nitrate, Nitrite, Orthophosphate, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus) prior to, during, and following BMP implementation.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has provided subwatershed (12-digit HUC) scale data for the state of Arkansas which indicate, on an average, threefold increase in the number of watersheds compared to 10-digit HUC level data.  Geomorphologic resolution of subwatersheds has been reported to dramatically affect the SWAT modeled runoff flow, sediment and nutrient outputs (Bingner et al.,1997; Mamillapalli, 1998; FitzHugh and MacKay,2000; Jha et al. ,2004; and Arabi et al., 2006).  Therefore model outputs will be constrained to 12-digit HUC boundaries in order to avoid errors due to scale issues.  During the first phase of modeling project conducted during 2008-2010, we used the latest release of SWAT model (SWAT2009) and available data to prioritize 12-digit subwatersheds for four 8-digit HUC priority watersheds namely, Illinois River Drainage Area in Arkansas (IRDAA), Beaver Reservoir (BR), Lake Conway Point Remove (LCPR) and Bayou Bartholomew (BR).  The study resulted in identifying prioritized watersheds based on their contribution of nonpoint sources at 12-digit HUC scale (Project # 08-300; Pai et al., 2011).  The ranking was developed using percentile scale with those falling in the 80-100th percentile being designated as priority subwatershed.  We propose to generate similarly ranked subwatershed for two 8-digit priority watersheds i.e. Cache River, and Lower Ouachita-Smackover.  This information about prioritized subwatersheds will help ANRC in making further management decisions.

Objectives
This project will calibrate and validate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model at locations with available flow and water quality data so that subwatersheds within the 8-digit HUCs of Cache River, and Lower Ouachita-Smackover watershed are assessed and ranked based on their contribution to non point source (NPS) pollution.  The project will monitor water quality and enter the required data into the WQX or STORET database. A qualitative comparison of one year long monitoring data with the model output at the 12-digit HUC level will be performed.  The impact of land use change on water quality shall be modeled for Cache river watershed to predict long term impact of Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP).

General Project Description

Watershed-based management planning typically occurs through six steps:
1.	Building partnerships,
2.	Characterizing the watershed,
3.	Finalizing management goals and identifying solutions,
4.	Designing an implementation program,
5.	Implementing the watershed-based management plan, and
6.	Measuring progress and making adjustments through adaptive management.

This project will proceed through the first four steps – building partnerships; characterizing the watershed; finalizing the vision, mission, goals, objectives, and management practices (i.e., solutions); and designing the implementation program. The results of these four steps will be documented in the nine element watershed-based management plan. Project tasks are described below.

Task 1 Build partnerships:  FTN will facilitate the formation of stakeholder teams to champion the development and implementation of the watershed-based management plan, emphasizing the socioeconomic benefits that can accrue to all stakeholders from restoring segments of the Cache River and its tributaries.  One team will address the Cache River watershed upstream of Grubbs, Arkansas, an area where the river and its tributaries are heavily channelized and have no riparian forest, and land use is dominated by row crop agriculture. A second team will address the Cache River watershed downstream of Grubbs, Arkansas, where the Cache River and its tributaries have natural channels, there is more forest, particularly in riparian areas, and there are state and federal wildlife management areas. Key stakeholder groups in the Cache River watershed include: Arkansas Association of Conservation Districts, Arkansas Farm Bureau, The Nature Conservancy, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. 

Task 2 Characterize the watershed: FTN will review existing studies and models of the Cache River watershed, and, if needed, further identify sources and causes of pollution (Plan element 1).

Task 3 Finalize management goals and identify solutions: FTN will work with the teams to create a vision, mission, and management goals for the Cache River watershed.  Management objectives for the northern and southern basin may be different. The teams will also determine the load reductions needed (Element 2), critical areas for management, and management actions/practices to achieve the management goals (Element 3) for the two subbasins.

Task 4 Design implementation program: In conjunction with the teams, FTN will design a program for implementing the goals and solutions, emphasizing the socioeconomic benefits that will accrue to the stakeholders when the plans are implemented.  This will involve estimating funding needs, and identifying funding sources (Element 4), developing information and education activities (Element 5), an implementation schedule and milestones (Elements 6 and 7), and identifying indicators and a program for monitoring and tracking progress (Elements 8 and 9).

Task 5 Prepare nine element watershed-based plan:  Utilizing the information gathered during tasks 1 through 4, FTN will prepare a single nine element watershed-based plan for the Cache River that incorporates any differences in objectives and/or management activities in the northern and southern basin. This plan will be reviewed by both of the teams, ANRC, and EPA,  and their comments incorporated.

Task 6 Reporting: All reports will be prepared and submitted (hard copies and electronically) according to the grant requirements.
1.	Quarterly reports will be submitted utilizing the format/forms provided electronically by ANRC and will briefly state accomplishments made for each task.  
2.	Final Report will be submitted to ANRC at the completion or the end date for the project.  A Final Report Guidance will be provided by ANRC in outline form.  The Final Report should be a narrative description and should encompass all activities (from start to finish) related to the project.  An executive summary as well as a final outcome and/or conclusion section shall be contained in the Final Report.  A minimum of two copies of the report are required.

After this project is completed, the nine element watershed-based plan will be implemented by local and agency stakeholders.


Objectives
The objective of this project is to prepare an EPA-accepted nine element watershed-based plan for the Cache River NPS priority watershed, while developing local support for the plan and its implementation. These objectives are planned steps toward the goal of reducing pollutants to levels that will restore the designated uses of the waterbodies within the Cache River watershed.

Nevada Outdoor School (NOS) seeks to reach students and educators with educational outreach to better understand their local watershed and non-point source pollution.  
This program will teach students what a watershed is, how it benefits communities, why clean water 
is important, how natural and man-made “systems” in a watershed are connected and how individual choices impact the future health of our water. The program will encourage youth and adult learners in rural Nevada to explore the outdoors and learn about science-based watershed education.  With this funding, students in rural Nevada experience their watershed and understand the potential impact of NPS pollution.  


Objectives
This Nevada Outdoor School endeavors to teach an understanding of the impact of NPS water pollution and to create responsible watershed stewards. To this end, it is essential to include  

o	ActionEducationTM - defined as education that empowers learners to take positive and 
appropriate action to solve a local water resource issue.
o	Stewardship - defined as taking steps to make a positive difference. Watershed stewardship, 
therefore, involves ActionEducationTM  to improve the health of a local watershed.

•	1000 students participate in classroom science lessons about water, watersheds and NPS pollution.
•	500 students participate in NOS led field trips to local waterways, with water quality testing, watershed models, run-off demonstrations.
•	10 educators participate in a Project W.E.T. workshop and share at least one activity with their own students within 90 days.  An additional 100 students will be reached with those activities.
•	20 students and 2 educators will be involved in seeding, growing and planting native species to help with the recovery of a burned area adjacent to their school in the small community of Paradise Valley, NV.   


Methods
Task 1:	 Nevada Outdoor School visits, on average, 70 classrooms each month during the school year.  
At least 50 lessons during the year will involve topics in water, watersheds and NPS pollution.  
Task 2:  Nevada Outdoor School will expand their watershed field trip initiative targeted to 2nd grade students with similar curriculum that teaches science-based watershed education to other communities beyond Winnemucca, using the local watershed as a model.  The watershed field trip will encourage youth and adult learners in rural Nevada to explore the outdoors. Field trips will be offered to schools in Winnemucca, Paradise Valley, Orovada (includes Kings River and McDermitt) and Elko.  
Task 3:  A Project W.E.T workshop will be offered to rural Nevada educators, to take place in Winnemucca, in the spring of 2013.  NOS’s Director of Programming will coordinate with the state Project W.E.T. Director to implement the training. The workshop will teach educators what a watershed is, how it benefits communities, why clean water is important, how natural and man-made “systems” in a watershed are connected and how individual choices impact the future health of our water. 
Task 4: Nevada Outdoor School will install a temporary green house at Paradise Valley School and work with students and teachers to raise bitterbrush seedlings through the winter to be planted in spring 2013.  Friends of Nevada Wilderness will work with NOS to facilitate seed collection as well as coordinate the planting projects.  The fire damage has a direct impact on the surface water quality in Paradise Valley and is a learning opportunity for the students, as well as, a chance for them to make a big difference as stewards in their community.  The planting and restoration work of the Hanson fire will call on volunteers from the general public as well.  This activity will directly reduce NPS pollution of soil erosion as re-vegetation is crucial for wildlife and riparian habitat.

The Upper Gila Watershed Steward Program is an education project that will enhance the Master Watershed Steward program. This will lead to the development of targeted water quality improvement projects in the impaired waters in the Upper Gila Watershed, and ultimately to the removal of these waters from the 303(d) list.

Objectives
The goal is to educate and recruit people that can expand and improve the capability and competence of the Gila Watershed Partnership, and develop targeted grant projects that will lead to reductions in our impaired waters.  These projects need to be coordinated and that will be accomplished in conjunction with a Watershed Implementation Plan prepared in collaboration between the GWP and NEMO.

Methods
	This project will target the Upper Gila Watershed. This will include landowners and other stakeholders such as local companies, organizations, etc.  In particular, we will be targeting individuals from the local governmental entities that have jurisdiction in the areas of impairment. This will include the county supervisors, city and town managers, health department directors, highway department managers, etc., as well as Eastern Arizona Community College students. We believe that the students are important,  as many of these students have parents who are stakeholders in the areas with impaired waters, and the students will go on to become landowners and policymakers as well.","N","Project Implementation","15040004","150400040606","N","07/01/2008","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:34960"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,35550

The recent Wallow Fire impacted two watersheds that have been targeted by ADEQ as priority locations for addressing nonpoint source water quality issues (the Little Colorado River Headwaters, impaired due to sediment; and the San Francisco/Blue, impaired due to E. coli).  The goal of this funding is to allow for early implementation of erosion control measures to protect water quality in these and other watersheds impacted by the burn.  DEMA is working closely with federal, state, county, and other local stakeholders to coordinate fire mitigation projects in the Wallow and other burn areas throughout the state. The ADEQ funding will be made available via a DEMA request for proposals to support projects with direct ties to protecting water quality by reducing nonpoint source pollution. 

$250,000 has been made available to DEMA in the form of an Interagency Service Agreement (ISA) with the following use criteria:

•	Funding will be made available for a two-year project period.
•	The federal share of any project implemented using Section 319(h) funding may not exceed 60 percent of implementation cost, and the nonfederal share must be provided by nonfederal sources. The nonfederal share for the must be at least 40 percent (CWA section 319(h)(3); 40 CFR 35.265). DEMA shall be responsible identifying, securing, and documenting the nonfederal match associated with this funding.  The minimum non-federal match required for the proposed federal contribution of $250,000 is $166,666. 
o	Match is calculated based on the following formula: 
(Total project cost) X (0.6) = Federal contribution
o	Non-federal match funds may be cash, goods, equipment usage, and/or services (i.e. in-kind services such as donated labor, office space, equipment usage, existing building usage, and base salaries of existing employees). Federal salaries cannot be used as match. 
•	Funding must be utilized to support erosion control projects that will reduce nonpoint source pollution to a water body within one of the Targeted Watershed areas (see maps enclosed).  
•	Salaries, overhead, or indirect costs for administrative services provided and charged against activities and programs carried out with the grant shall not exceed 10 percent of the grant award.  Any remaining administrative costs must be covered by matching funds.  
•	DEMA and any sub-recipients of the funding shall adhere to Federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and codes, as applicable, and shall obtain all required approvals and permits.  All recipients shall also coordinate and obtain approvals from all site owners and operators.
•	The following types of projects are ineligible for Section 319(h) funding:
o	Projects that do not deal with reducing or eliminating a non-point source of pollution to a water body; 
o	Projects that deal with hook-up to sewer, improvements to sewers, waste water treatment facilities, or other permit-regulated facilities;

"214","items",NA,"SC",49140,"Hard Labor Creek Watershed Water Quality Improvement Project","$173,462","Overview
The environmental health of the Hard Labor Creek watershed is currently impaired by non-point sources of fecal coliform pollution.  Hard Labor Creek is a tributary to Stevens Creek, which eventually flows into the Savannah River.  The TMDL implementation area is a subwatershed of the 12-digit HUC, and located above monitoring point SV-151.

Hard Labor Creek has been on the SC 303(d) list since 1998, as 52% of the samples at SV-151 exceeded the water quality standard. This occurred during normal flow and low flow periods.  FC will need to be reduced by 64% in order to reach acceptable standards according to the TMDL standard established in the TMDL Watershed Characterization Document of June 2005.  

The watershed consists of 8184 acres to the west and south of Greenwood, SC.  Land uses within the watershed include forestland (53%), agricultural (27%), developed (19%), with small amounts of open water and wetlands.  Agricultural uses include primarily hayland and livestock/pasture, with very limited crop production.  In this area most of the development is characterized by low-density, residential use.  The watershed includes a portion of the city of Greenwood, where most of the 2150 houses and the 450 apartments are located.  City housing consists of an old mill village and several small old housing developments as well as some more modern developments, a golf course and Connie Maxwell Children’s Home with a working farm.  There are several areas of multi-family housing identified inn the city, and these will be of interest as we develop our pet waste campaign.  There is no designated Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) present. 

Outside the city of Greenwood, the dominant use is agricultural, and pasture and hayland is by far the leading farm use.  There are about 15 livestock producers with an average herd of about 35 animals.  Forest land occupies almost half of the watershed and features stands of pine and mixed pine/hardwood stands of varying age classes, ranging from recent clearcuts to managed middle age stands, and offering a wide variety of habitats for wildlife.   SC DNR will assist us with assessments of the impacts of wildlife on FC at the monitoring station and may recommend measures for alternative watering systems for deer, raccoons and others.

We will hold public meetings for all user groups including septic system users, livestock operators, and pet owners, which represent our target sources.  We will use input from these meetings to develop our social marketing strategy using locally stated values.  We will work toward identifying any sources of direct discharge from leaky delivery lines into the creek by working with the WWTF to correct any point sources. (Note: Point sources are not the target of this project and will not receive financial assistance, but we recognize that any point sources from the WWTF may impact our ability to meet our target of 64% FC reduction.)  


Objectives
We expect to achieve a 64% or greater reduction in the presence of FC readings at SV-151.  Ultimate goal is to implement the TMDL to meet established water quality standards.

Methods
We will initiate this project with public information and outreach meetings and follow up with two implementation phases, the first targeting landowners immediately adjacent to the creek, and offering cost-share assistance to remove livestock from direct deposit situations and to repair or replace failing septic systems.  The second phase will concentrate on nearby landowners who are also likely to impact water quality. A pet waste campaign will be on-going through the life of the grant.  We will hire a technician to deliver the program, and oversight of the grant will be handled by the Ninety Six District RC&D.","Y","Project Implementation","03050109","030501090701","N","07/09/2009","Revised","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:49140"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Pathogens (Coliform), Nitrogen",173462

Within this project, the Bitter/Killpecker watershed will connect and protect up to 1,413,961 acres of land, on all sides of the described creeks, in order to preserve, protect, restore, and educate the public about an ecological highlight within the county.  This biologically diverse ecosystem will provide important habitat for many wildlife species, and aims to create an ecotourism center and a peaceful respite from busy urban lives for those from the Rock Springs urban area, Sweetwater County, or even out of state tourism.
Segments of Bitter and Killpecker Creeks in Sweetwater County have been listed on the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) 303d list (2000 and 2008) for fecal coliform/E. coli and chloride.  These remain listed in the Wyoming’s current Integrated 305(b) and 303(d) Report.  To address water quality issues related to these impairment listings, the Sweetwater County Conservation District (SWCCD), under the guidance and leadership of the Bitter/Killpecker Watershed Advisory Group (BKWAG), has conducted:
•	An inventory of historical water quality related information and data (2003).
•	Water quality sampling and analysis to determine the condition of the Bitter/Killpecker Creeks Watershed (2004-2005).
•	Reporting on 2004-2005: Bitter/Killpecker Creek Watershed Study, 2006.
•	Supplemental sampling to refine report findings (2006-2008.)
•	Water quality sampling and analysis to confirm 2008 WDEQ 303d chloride and E. coli impairment extension within the Bitter/Killpecker Creeks Watershed (2009-2010).
•	BMP implementation since the listing of the stream.

During 2004 and 2005, the SWCCD implemented a Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) designed to determine specifically what reaches and tributaries of Bitter Creek and Killpecker Creek are impaired and for what constituents.  This Sampling and Analysis Plan was revised and implemented to conduct a supplemental monitoring program to gather additional data and refine findings in 2006 through 2010.
For 2011 and 2012, the SWCCD has begun working in coordination with WDEQ to continue water quality and quantity monitoring within the Bitter and Killpecker Creek watershed to further refine data and analysis in preparation of the development of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) assignment within the impairments.  A new SAP has been prepared and approved by WDEQ for this monitoring program.
The SWCCD will utilize the expertise and experience of the District Supervisors, the Advisory group, WDEQ, and consultants, to fulfill the project’s objectives.  EDE Consultants of Sheridan Wyoming has conducted the project sampling/monitoring, data collection/compilation, data analysis, and reporting to date.  EDE Consultants is anticipated to continue in this role for the project work outlined within the 2011-2012 SAP.  The Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts, the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service may provide project assistance if necessary and as requested.
	To date, sampling has indicated that sources contributing to the fecal impairment status are related at least in part to:
1)	Historic waste water discharges (septic systems), aged/faulty wastewater, and storm water routing infrastructure within rural areas of Rock Springs and near Reliance.
2)	Naturally occurring fecal sources (wildlife and livestock) in non-developed portions of Bitter Creek upstream of Rock Springs.

Five-day geometric-mean concentrations of E. coli have been seen to exceed the primary criterion of 126 col/100 ml along the length of Bitter Creek within the study area, but not necessarily in a consistent fashion over the length of the study period.  The greatest concentrations and most consistent exeedences have been observed to occur within and downstream of Rock Springs on both Bitter and Killpecker Creeks with a high value of 6,382 col/100ml on Killpecker Creek near Reliance.  However, results from the most recent sampling in 2010 indicate that E. coli concentrations may be declining over those seen earlier in the study at some sites, possibly because of BMP practices being implemented within Rock Springs to improve wastewater routing infrastructure.  Study data have not revealed a definite relation between E. coli concentrations and low and high stream flow, but it does appear that E. coli concentrations may be elevated in the fall over those observed in the spring.  While flow data have been accumulated during the study, a thorough evaluation of E. coli loading during the study has not been completed.

To date, the primary sources of the chloride impairment appear related to natural concentrations of chloride within native soils.  Significant areas having these soils appear to occur along Killpecker Creek north of Interstate 80 and south of Hwy 191 crossings and near the confluence of Bitter Creek and Deadman Draw near Point of Rocks.  Road and highway salting during the winter months only go to the city limits and does not extend out to Point of Rocks and the Bitter Creek headwater areas.

Chloride concentrations have been seen to range from much less than the 230 mg/l chronic chloride criterion in the upper reaches of the Bitter Creek study area, to exceeding the chronic criterion upstream of the Killpecker Creek confluence with Bitter Creek, and to exceeding the acute criterion of 860 mg/l in Killpecker Creek and in Bitter Creek downstream of the Bitter- Killpecker Creek confluence.  Chloride concentrations as high as 37,000 mg/l have been observed in Killpecker Creek.  As a Class 3B stream, the chloride criterion and impairment do not apply to Killpecker Creek; however, its discharge to Bitter Creek is seen as a major source to the impairment listing in Bitter Creek.  The primary source of chloride to Killpecker Creek appears to be a large native soils area/salt flat just north of Interstate 80.  Study data have not revealed a definite relation between chloride concentrations and low and high stream flow, but it does appear that chloride concentrations may be elevated in the fall over those observed in the spring.  While flow data have been accumulated during the study, a thorough evaluation of chloride loading during the study has not been completed.

Priorities of the current 2011–2012 sampling and reporting activities are to further refine data and analysis in preparation of TMDL development for the water quality impairments, and to allow direct involvement and interface between the SWCCD, BKWAG, local municipal and industry entities, and the WDEQ in the TMDL process.  
 WDEQ has scheduled development of TMDLs for the Bitter and Killpecker Creek impairments to begin in 2012.  While a goodly amount of water quality data and instantaneous flow data have been collected to evaluate and confirm the impairments to date, the long length of the impairments and large size of the watershed relative to the number of monitoring sites established minimizes conclusions drawn from the dataset for some areas.  Insights attained from the monitoring to date provide an opportunity to supplement the data and test conclusions with additional monitoring.  For instance, examination of a potential reduction in E. coli concentrations observed in 2010 at several sites within Rock Springs, possibly resulting from BMP implementation could be accomplished.
The monitoring proposed within this project proposal is necessary to augment the monitoring done in the watershed to date, in order to assess any changes/improvements in water quality since previous monitoring was conducted and collect new data, so that WDEQ bases development of TMDL criteria on the most accurate watershed data.  Additionally, collection of continuous flow data as proposed at selected sites (as coordinated with WDEQ) will allow insight into flow loading that is critical to accurately developing the TMDL.  Moreover, as TMDLs are continually revisited (per WDEQ guidelines) and as future development and water quality changes may be observed within the watershed, a more robust 2003-2012 baseline water quality dataset will enhance the ability to make appropriate management decisions for the good of the water resource. 


Objectives
To address fecal and chloride water quality impairments within the Bitter and Killpecker Creek watersheds through monitoring, public education and outreach, developing partnerships, and information sharing.

Methods
1.	Conducting water quality monitoring to refine and confirm Bitter and Killpecker Creek water quality assessment information.
2.	Collect water quality data for TMDL development and baseline reference and collaborate activities with WDEQ in preparation for slated 2012 TMDL development.  This includes increasing the amount of baseline data, especially flow data, which will be important to achieve a more realistic model of TMDL development. 
3.	Provide public education and outreach to increase public knowledge of water quality and nonpoint source pollution, and help develop partnerships with local governments and agencies on water quality issues. 
4.	Provide summary and detailed reporting of sampling results and present results and TMDL planning information to the SWCCD, BKWAG, local industry, other interested entities, and the public.

The project goal is to establish regionally based temperature criterion for cold-water fisheries that reflects the variability of natural parameters affecting temperature in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

Objectives
To meet the project goal, four objectives have been identified as part of this project:
Objective 1: Identify growth and lethal temperature thresholds for cold-water fisheries
based on a literature review of fish temperature tolerances.
Objective 2: Compile data and evaluate the current temperature regimes in the Black
Hills region.
Objective 3: Evaluate current beneficial use attainment of Black Hills streams.
Objective 4: Determine which Black Hills streams would be considered impaired,
based on the recommended temperature criteria.



Methods
Objective 1. 
Task 1: Literature Review. Extensive research has been performed reviewing
temperature thresholds for cold-water fish species.

Objective 2.
Task 2. Gather and Compile Available Data. Data have been collected by numerous
agencies (i.e., SD DENR, SD GFP, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), USFS, Bureau of
Reclamation, and South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM&T)) in the past on the
cold-water streams in the Black Hills.

Task 3. Conduct Numerical Statistical Analyses. Understanding correlations between
water-quality constituents (e.g., temperature) and physical and biological stream metrics can
lead to a higher understanding of the potential stream impairments.

Task 4. Model Temperature for Black Hills Streams. One common data shortcoming in
watershed assessment and TMDL projects is having paired flow and water-quality data. For
this project, flow and temperature data will not necessarily be at the same spatial location as
biological and physical habitat data. Paired data will be necessary to understand the level of
impairment of beneficial uses, the true source of the impairment (other factors besides
temperature that may be causing beneficial use impairment), and the stream’s ability to meet
the proposed temperature criteria.

Objective 3. 
Task 5. Conduct Geospatial Analyses. Results of the HSPF model and the complete
project geodatabase will be used to further develop flow and temperature duration curves to
analyze and identify correlations between stream temperature and fisheries parameters,
geophysical parameters, and meteorological parameters.

Objective 4.
Task 6. Conduct Temperature Data Impairment Analyses. Once the modeling and data
analysis are complete and temperature criteria reflecting impairment of the beneficial uses are
developed, it will be important to evaluate which stream segments in the Black Hills will still
be listed as impaired, compared to the newly developed temperature criterion. This will be
based on the HSPF model results and available data following procedures used by the SD DENR
when generating their biannual Integrated Reports of Surface Water Quality.

Task 7. Best Management Practice Simulation. The final step in evaluating any potential temperature criterion is the ability of an impaired stream to meet its numeric
criterion, ultimately leading to its support of its assigned beneficial uses. Standard BMP scenarios, such as improving riparian cover and increasing shading, will be simulated in the HSPF model, developed in Task 4.

The Belle Fourche River Watershed Partnership is the project sponsor for this 1-year project.  The contractor will use the existing database, the HSPF model application, and existing in-house MATLAB and GIS-related tools to cost-effectively develop TMDL documents on the temperature-impaired stream segments within the Whitewood Creek and Bear Butte Creek Watersheds. They are using a watershed-based approach that has the ability to address multiple impairments in a holistic manner. This method, also used in the Battle Creek Temperature TMDL project, combines the key elements of methods applied in other states to obtain EPA-approved TMDLs.

Objectives
Phase II will build upon the hydrology model calibrated during Phase I of the project and will
include a calibration to the observed temperature data within the project area. When the HSPF
model application is finalized, continuous discharge, which was simulated for each point of
interest (i.e., a current or anticipated TMDL endpoint), will be multiplied by the temperature
standard to create a load duration curve, which is the allowable load, by flow regime. The
source allocation will be determined through a net energy balance calculated on a daily timestep
that considers the solar radiation (short wave and long wave), convection from air,
conduction of the stream bed, evaporation and condensation, and any point sources. Naturalversus-
anthropogenic conditions will be estimated based on observed data describing the range
7 Innovation • Collaboration • Inspiration
of riparian conditions and the vegetative potential for each impaired stream reach. In-stream
loads will be determined using stream temperature and flow monitoring data expressed in units
of heat energy per day. The differences between the allowable loads and the current loads will
reveal the needed heat reduction targets. These targets will be the basis for setting
benchmarks for future Best Management Practice (BMP) implementation, which will be
informed by both the load allocation analysis and modeling scenarios. This process will result
in an assessment report with corresponding TMDL summaries for impaired reaches that
include optimized, cost-effective, and realistic implementation plans.

Methods
Phase II of this project will include an assessment report with corresponding
TMDL summaries for impaired reaches. A minimum of three, possibly as many as seven,
TMDL summaries are anticipated to be included in the final report for this project.","N","Project Implementation","10120111","101201110604","N","07/01/2014","Ahead of Schedule","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:92420"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,86139

Restore all waters impaired by nonpoint sources that are listed on the 1998 303(d) List to the condition of fully supporting their designated uses by 2015, in cooperation with local, state and federal partners. Long Term Goal 4. Beginning in 2006, through regulatory and non-regulatory means, prevent previously unlisted waters from being included on the 303(d) List because of nonpoint source impairments. •	Promote integration of point and nonpoint source (nps) water pollution agency functions,•	Coordinate with TDEC’s Watershed Management and Planning and Standards sections on nps issues and watershed strategies,•	To assure the effective monitoring of point source and nps impacted stream reaches,•	Use ground and surface water data collected by other agencies to target watersheds, develop nps strategy, and monitor effectiveness of BMP projects,•	Encourage and coordinate with other agencies and groups with regards to ground and surface water studies and monitoring,•	Coordinate with appropriate TDEC divisions to acquire water assessment data, and•	Coordinate with TDEC – WPC to update Nonpoint Source Assessment Report using 305(b) Report and 303(d) List as well as other data. •	Use 10% to fund ancillary support projects.

Methods
DESCRIPTION - The project involves removing selected stream segments and waterbodies or at least certain contributing sources from the 303(d) List and/or addressing impacted streams to prevent them from being added to the list. The project will be implemented as follows: A. The TDA will preliminarily identify ‘high feasibility’ projects from the 303(d) List. ‘High feasibility’ projects include those impaired streams that appear to be strong candidate sites for correction or ‘repair’ through focused BMP work. Criteria for ‘high feasibility’ include relatively small watersheds or stream segments with reasonably well-defined sources of impact. Any 303(d) listed stream that appears to have a potential for remediation in the short term and subsequent de - listing will be considered regardless of pollution type or source. This is not limited to agriculture as a source. B. When necessary, field level assessments will be conducted by TDA (and TDEC staff when deemed necessary) in cooperation with other groups such as: district conservationists (NRCS), RC&D coordinators, UTAES, TVA and any agency or organization that has the capability to significantly assist with BMP implementation efforts. Field assessments will examine each of the ‘high feasibility’ stream segments to: (1) confirm 303(d) listed sources of impact  (2)  preliminarily identify sources of impact  (3)	identify general scope and scale of necessary BMPs   (4)	determine project implementation participants (agencies and organizations) including an evaluation of technical assistance delivery capabilities 
(5) determine necessary monitoring and assessment protocols to confirm success of  BMPs
(6) estimate timeframe necessary to achieve de - listing status (if applicable). C. TDA field staff in cooperation with district conservationists and respective SCDs will identify and contact those landowners that are candidates for BMPs. Project concept, cost-share provisions, conditions, etc. will be discussed with the landowner. The potential for project effectiveness will be estimated on the basis of the number and type of BMPs that must be installed to achieve remediation as well as the contingency of landowner participation. While project implementation may focus on or emphasize particular resource needs, any actual or potential source of nps pollution will be identified and considered for current or future BMP implementation work. D. If a ‘high feasibility’ project is determined to be potentially effective, a funding allocation from the State Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund and Section 319 will be made to the appropriate project implementation entity which will most likely be the SCD(s), RC&D Council or TVA. Allocation will be based upon number and type of BMPs as well as estimated implementation schedules. E. TDA staff will monitor the installation of BMPs and associated cost - share activities. F. TDA staff is to maintain project information database including GIS (geospatial data) analysis and reporting. To the extent possible annual changes (improvements) in water quality will be evaluated. Project development and progress will be reported in a format useful for information and education purposes on current as well as future projects Monitoring and assessment will be done as necessary to understand the effectiveness of BMP installation. G. Based upon a determination of BMP effectiveness, TDA and TDEC will conclude the following: (1) remove the respective segment from the 303(d) List, or(2)	remove the respective sources that have been corrected by BMPs, or(3) re - evaluate need for more or different types of BMPs to achieve objective of de -listing. MILESTONES* Each year the soil conservation districts, along with other agencies, submit potential projects, comprised of a list of potential BMPs in 303(d) watersheds, to the TDA Nonpoint Source staff. * TDA staff evaluates the submittals and allocates funds according to the cost effectiveness of the project.","Y","Project Implementation","06010201","060102010303","Y","10/01/2003","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:10179"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen",354133

PROJECT LOCATION:

University of Tennessee Research and Education Center at Greeneville and 
Pond Creek watershed (listed on 303 d list of impaired watersheds).

BACKGROUND:

This project was started in July 2001. The use of alum as an in-house poultry litter amendment to control ammonia emissions and reduce the amount of soluble phosphorus in the land-applied poultry litter was demonstrated on poultry farms across the state from 2001 to 2004. Bio-security concerns and new guidelines imposed by some of the poultry companies during the course of this project, made it impossible to conduct the planned producer field days in and around active poultry farms. 

In April 2005 the terms of the original contract were amended to revise some of the objectives of this project to:

1.	Demonstrate the forage quality impacts of the over-application of alum treated and untreated poultry litter
2.	Implement best management practices (BMPs) on beef and dairy farms in Pond Creek, such as the installation of geotextiles and other improvements in heavy use areas, fencing, improved stream crossings, over-seeding of overgrazed and eroded sites in the watershed, and the provision of alternative watering systems for cattle excluded from the creek

This project continues to demonstrate the forage quality impacts of the over-application of poultry litter on fescue quality and to implement best management practices on beef and dairy farms in Pond Creek.

THE PROBLEM:

Land application of broiler litter on fescue pastures and hay is a common use from broiler litter in Tennessee. While broiler litter is a good source of the major plant nutrients, it is an unbalanced source of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Farmers who apply broiler litter based on the nitrogen content will over-apply phosphorus and potassium. The over-application of phosphorus from poultry litter has been implicated as a probable cause of impaired water quality in some 303 (d) listed streams. The phosphorus in this litter typically is applied at rates far exceeding crop requirements, and is often in a highly soluble form, which can easily impact water quality. 

The use of alum (aluminum sulfate) as litter treatment will significantly reduce (>70 percent) the amount of soluble reactive phosphorus in the runoff from fields where alum treated litter has been applied and can have a significant impact in watersheds where phosphorus is responsible for water quality impairments. There is however, little economic incentive for farmers to use alum at the rates required to tie-up most of the phosphorus in poultry litter. 

There is a need to demonstrate to farmers that the over-application of poultry litters can have a significant negative impact on forage quality due to the over-application of potassium. Reductions in forage quality can result in significant economic impacts on cattle producers.

Additionally there is a need to demonstrate other BMPs that will improve water quality to farmers in the Pond Creek, a watershed where water quality is impacted by beef and dairy operations.




Objectives
Long Term Goal 
Restore all waters impaired by nonpoint sources that are listed on the 1998 303(d) List to the condition of fully supporting their designated uses by 2015, in cooperation with local, state, and federal partners.

Long Term Goal 
Improve the knowledge of stakeholders and citizens concerning the origins, magnitude and prevention of non-point source pollution.

PROJECT / PROGRAM OBJECTIVE:

To demonstrate to poultry producers the use of a new litter treatment technology to reduce the risk of pollution to the environment while improving productivity and best management practices (BMPs) for dairy and beef producers.
PROGRAM / PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

1.	Demonstrate and compare the forage quality impacts of application of poultry litter on fescue hay at rates that meet plant nitrogen requirements (but exceed potassium requirements) and meet potassium requirements.
2.	Implement best management practices on beef and dairy farms in Pond Creek. These BMPs will include the installation of geotextiles and other improvements in heavy use areas, fencing, improved stream crossings, over-seeding of overgrazed and eroded sites in the watershed, and the provision of alternative watering systems for cattle excluded from the creek

PROJECT MILESTONES:

1.	Conduct a field demonstration to compare the effect of different poultry litter application rates on fescue yields and the forage quality
2.	Implement a number of BMPs for pasture based beef and dairy operations in an on-going watershed project in Pond Creek



Methods
1.	Conduct a field demonstration to compare the effect of different poultry litter application rates on fescue yields and the forage quality

2.	Implement a number of BMPs for pasture based beef and dairy operations in an on-going watershed project in Pond Creek

 In summary, 
1.	Soil sampling and forage sample costs for the litter demonstration now underway at the Tobacco Experiment Station in Greeneville
2.	Implementing BMPs in Pond Creek (installation of geotextiles and other improvements in heavy use areas, fencing, improved stream crossings, over-seeding of overgrazed and eroded sites in the watershed, and the provision of alternative watering systems for cattle excluded from the creek).
Soil samples will be collected before and after the fescue growing season on each of the 36 plots at the litter demonstration now underway at the Tobacco Experiment Station in Greeneville. Each soil sample will cost $14 to analyze (basic test plus micro-nutrients) at the University of Tennessee Extension soil test laboratory in Nashville. 

Forage samples will be collected after the harvest of fescue in May and September on each of the 36 plots at Greeneville. Each forage sample will cost $20 for analysis (basic quality test plus mineral nutrients) by the SureTech Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN.

PROJECT LOCATION:

The Pond Creek watershed (TN06010202013) is part of the Upper Tennessee Basin in east Tennessee. Pond Creek covers parts of McMinn, Monroe and Loudon counties. Several segments of the watershed was listed on the 2004 and the draft 2006 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies in Tennessee; 

•	Mud Creek (TN06010201013-0100): 		  7.2miles
•	Greasy Branch (TN06010201013-0200): 	  7.3 miles
•	Pond Creek (TN06010201013-1000 7 2000): 	21.1 miles
The University of Tennessee Extension, in collaboration with other agencies in Tennessee, is proposing to expand a water quality improvement project in the Pond Creek watershed (TN06010202013) in the Upper Tennessee Basin of Eastern Tennessee. Agriculture in the Pond Creek watershed is typical of beef cow-calf and dairy systems in the Southeastern United States. Pond Creek is listed on the 303(d) list as an impaired stream in Tennessee for pathogens and nutrients. Dairy and beef cattle operations are the main agricultural activities in the watershed and are suspected to be responsible for much of the pollution. The project is seeking to address non-point source impairments in the Pond Creek Watershed and install best management practices (BMPs) and restore it to the condition of fully supporting its designated uses.

Collaborating agencies that have invested time, money and other resources in support of this project are the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) non-point source program, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4, Water Management Division. Representatives of these agencies have been working on various projects within Pond Creek. Significant work and collaboration between these agencies in the Pond Creek watershed have created the need for additional financial support to enhance the efforts of these agencies.

In April 2003, with support from the Tennessee Valley Authority, Tennessee Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, the University of Tennessee Extension initiated a long-term project to improve water quality in Pond Creek. During the initial phase of this project (April to Sept. 2003) an inventory of the Pond Creek watershed was developed by the University of Tennessee Extension in collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). A detailed photo interpretation of aerial photographs taken in March 2002 was used to develop a GIS-based assessment of land-use in the watershed using the Integrated Pollutant Source Identification (or IPSI) watershed management tool developed by TVA. The IPSI assessment was used to develop a watershed restoration plan in 2006. 




Objectives
The ultimate objective of this project is to implement agricultural BMPs that will improve water quality and remove the Pond Creek watershed from the 303(d) list of impaired watersheds for Tennessee. 

In 2006, a watershed restoration plan for Pond Creek  was developed by the University of Tennessee Extension, in collaboration with partners and stakeholders from the watershed.  The plan recommended a phased introduction of BMPs. We are proposing to implement practices that be initiated immediately and that require minimal cost or planning, such as riparian buffers and fences.

We will continue to monitor water quality throughout this project and explore other funding sources.
Long Term Goal 1
Hold regularly scheduled meetings with stakeholders, to create new partnerships, strengthen existing partnerships and foster greater trust, commitment and accountability. This will be achieved through the formation of a watershed management group.

Long Term Goal 2
Fully implement all developed TMDLs for non-point sources in compliance with existing regulations, policies or agreements by 2015. This will be achieved through the development of a watershed plan in collaboration with the watershed management group.

Long Term Goal 3
Restore all waters impaired by non-point sources that are listed on the 1998 303(d) List to the condition of fully supporting their designated uses by 2015, in cooperation with local, state, and federal partners. Changes in agricultural practices in Pond Creek will reduce the impact of agriculture in particular dairy and beef operations on water quality in Pond Creek.

Long Term Goal 5
Improve the knowledge of stakeholders and citizens concerning the origins, magnitude, and prevention of non-point source pollution.

Long Term Goal 7
Use the maximum allowable percentage of funding annually to assist partners with water quality monitoring and assessment, for the duration of the TDA-NPS Program.

The ultimate objective of this project is to implement agricultural BMPs that will improve water quality and remove the Pond Creek watershed from the 303(d) list of impaired watersheds for Tennessee. To successfully remove Pond Creek from the Tennessee 303(d) list will require a reduction of pathogens of 99% based on the TMDL; a reduction of nitrogen of 82% based on ecoregion reference streams; and although not presently listed as a priority impairment, a reduction of phosphorus of 80%. The TMDL identifies pollutant sources such as pasture grazing, livestock in stream and animal feeding operations, all classified as non-point pollutant sources. The restoration plan was developed for the area building upon established partnerships and utilizing a recently developed suite of remote sensing tools to quantify non-point source pollutant loading. The plan identified current pollutant estimates, suggests best management practices (BMPs), and estimates subsequent post-plan pollution fates and volumes. 
MEASURES OF SUCCESS:

1.	Identification of stakeholders willing to implement BMPs
2.	Installation of appropriate BMPs on dairy and beef operations in the watershed: improve vegetative cover of exposed soils, improve management of pastures, stream crossings, alternative watering systems for cattle. 
3.	Prevent Pond Creek from being listed for impairments other than pathogens and nutrients.
4.	Development and distribution of Extension education materials to producers in watershed



Methods
The project will be implemented by the University of Tennessee Extension in collaboration with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA), Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the United State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

The co-ordinator will continue to be the point of contact between stakeholders and the project. She has been instrumental in encouraging farmers to implement a number of BMPs, as well as apply for USDA funding to build manure storage structures.  

Continued support of the activities of the watershed coordinator and funds to assist producers with the implementation of BMPs beyond 2007 is vital for the success of this project.

According to the Watershed Restoration Plan improvements in water quality in Pond Creek will require the following BMPs:  

1.	Limiting direct access of livestock to the stream
2.	Re-vegetating livestock loafing areas and pastures
3.	Establishing sufficient riparian buffers
4.	Repairing stream access sites
5.	Following a prescribed grazing management plan
6.	Developing and following site-specific nutrient management; 
7.	Properly maintaining septic systems 
8.	Installing manure holding facilities

Anticipated costs for the whole restoration initiative are estimated at $1,175,000, with nearly 100% of this budget for on-the-ground BMP implementation and installation. The plan proposes a three-phased approach based on: 

•	Phase 1: BMPs that can be initiated immediately, generally requiring minimal cost or planning, such as riparian buffers and fences
•	Phase 2: BMPs that require significant planning and development, design specifications, and/or additional funding, such as manure holding facilites and stream access sites 
•	Phase 3: BMPs for which success may depend on the success of a previously implemented BMP, such as many structural BMPs. 

We are proposing to implement the Phase 1 components of the watershed restoration plan. Specific objectives of this phase of the project will be to:

1.	Provide science-based water quality information to producers that will encourage them to actively work to protect and improve the waters of the Pond Creek watershed.
2.	Continue monitoring to document improvements to the watershed.
3.	Implement BMPs on farms in the watershed:

•	Fencing: 5,600 feet
•	Vegetation of exposed soils: 30 acres
•	Renovation of 100 acres of pastures
•	Installation of 3 watering systems, 2 stream crossings
•	Install a watering system, pipe and fencing that would move dairy cows approximately 1.5 miles from the stream (they are currently being fed and watered adjacent to the creek)
•	Improvement of farm roads
•	Maintenance and repair of septic systems
•	Establishment of 10 acres of riparian buffers

4.	Secure funding to assist producers with BMP implementation

The project will continue to work with stakeholders in the watershed to monitor water quality and implementing best management practices (BMPs). Producers will be encouraged to seek cost-share funds for BMP implementation from current programs administered by USDA.

Additional funding to expand this water quality improvement project will enable us to reach, educate and effect much-needed change in the Pond Creek watershed, and ensure greater community participation in watershed management and watershed management decisions.

Support for this project is only guaranteed through part of 2007. There is an urgent need to build on the work of these initial efforts to improve water quality in Pond Creek.

Within one year of contract start date, establish regular Pond Creek stakeholder watershed management group meetings.

Within one year of contract start date, establish BMPs on farms across the watershed.

Within two years of contract start date, attend and present results of Pond Creek watershed project at state and national water quality meetings and conferences.

Within 30 months of contract start date, host watershed tour for watershed stakeholders.

Submit Progress and Close-Out Reports as specified in the contract.

Nonpoint source pollution is the number one contributor to water pollution in Kentucky, accounting for approximately 2/3 of the impairments in Kentucky’s streams and lakes, including impairments associated with urban runoff around more populated areas and cities, agriculture, failing septic systems, straight pipes, forestry, construction, and the channelization of many streams for various purposes (2). The Four Rivers Basin has approximately 785 miles of stream partially supporting their designated use, and 600 miles of streams not supporting their designated use (1).  Education and outreach activities, watershed planning projects, and implementation projects will all be required to address these impairments in the Four Rivers Basin, and a Four Rivers Basin Coordinator is an aptly qualified individual to perform these activities.

The Four Rivers Basin Coordinator employed through this project will work with communities, watershed groups, regulatory agencies, businesses, industries and citizens in the Four Rivers Basin to improve water quality and reduce through nonpoint source pollution through the implementation of projects that will directly improve water quality, and through educational and outreach activities that will work to change the mindset of individuals and indirectly improve water quality. The basin coordinator will work hand in hand with the Kentucky Division of Water to implement the Watershed Management Framework, including the Nonpoint Source Management Program. The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team, meeting bi-monthly, to provide technical assistance for water quality projects, and outreach for local communities with water quality concerns.

Methods
The Jackson Purchase Foundation (JPF) will continue to staff the position of Four Rivers Basin Coordinator.  The Four Rivers Basin Coordinator will continue work throughout the Four Rivers Basin to accomplish the goals, objectives, and activities described in Section 16 of this project application, with an ultimate goal of improving water quality and reducing nonpoint source pollution in the Four Rivers Basin through education, outreach, and project implementation.

One of the project goals identified for this project includes the implementation of the KDOW Watershed Management Approach, including the Kentucky Nonpoint Source Management Program.  Various activities will be performed to accomplish this goal.  The basin coordinator will hold Four Rivers Basin Team meetings bi-monthly, and will work to ensure the Four Rivers Basin Team is composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds, each contributing a unique perspective to water quality management, including regulatory agencies, universities, local industries, agriculture, local governments and health departments, etc.  The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team to select priority areas for watershed protection and restoration, and then try to work with local individuals or other interested parties in those priority areas to develop projects that will improve water quality in them.  The basin coordinator will work with the Four Rivers Basin Team to ensure that impaired and special use waters, especially those affected by nonpoint source pollution, will be adequately addressed.  Minutes from each Four Rivers Basin Team will be submitted to the KDOW Nonpoint Source Section, and the basin coordinator will facilitate communication between the different branches of the KDOW and the Four Rivers Basin Team.  The basin coordinator will also work with local watershed groups and interested individuals, helping them to focus their concerns into successful projects, and provide technical assistance to their water quality related projects, including the development, administration, and management phases of these projects.  The basin coordinator will work with these groups, both developing and established groups, to ensure successful partnerships are fostered between all stakeholders, including federal and state regulatory agencies, local governments and health departments, local industries, universities, and other nonprofit groups.

Another project goal identified for this project includes the encouragement of cooperation and communication between communities and watershed groups with similar water quality issues and water resource concerns.  Activities that will be performed to accomplish this goal will include facilitating the transfer of information between watershed groups, like the Red River Watershed Association, an established group that has performed many successful projects, and the Little River Task Force, which is a group in its infancy that could learn from the Red River Watershed Association, and between local communities facing the same issues, such as the local MS4 communities, or communities trying to address karst impacts on water quality.  The basin coordinator will also encourage the duplication and implementation of successful projects from other river basins that are applicable in the Four Rivers Region.  For example, the bacterial source tracking project performed in the Dix River Watershed in the Kentucky River Basin could be an extremely useful tool throughout the Four Rivers Basin in tracking down the source of pathogen contamination.  

A third project goal identified includes increasing awareness and support for watershed conservation throughout the Four Rivers Basin.  This goal will be accomplished through educational and outreach activities.  Some of these activities will focus on community leaders, local citizens, schools, businesses, industry and other various groups to provide information about the importance of water quality, stream protection, and watershed conservation, including actions each individual can take to protect water quality and reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Meetings and information sessions will be held with the different sectors, and will be tailored to each different sector.  The basin coordinator will meet and work with the different MS4 communities to assist with education and outreach activities, including working with these communities to develop a water quality informational booth for local festivals, and providing training and informational sessions for different MS4 related activities and regulations.  The basin coordinator will also participate in information sessions throughout the Four Rivers Basin to educate the public about watershed health, nonpoint source pollution, and activities or practices that protect our watersheds and reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Some of these sessions will include Barbeque on the River Festival in Paducah, Murray State University Sustainability Conference, Little River Days in Christian County, and various other events the basin coordinator is invited to.  The basin coordinator will update the Four Rivers Basin Status Report with current conditions for the basin, and distribute this report to citizens of the Four Rivers Basin. The basin coordinator will assist Four Rivers Watershed Watch in accomplishing their mission, by providing information to local communities and individuals about the program and their goals, helping to recruit new volunteers, and assisting with data analysis and interpretation.  The basin coordinator will attend speaking engagements to distribute information about Four Rivers Watershed Watch, and will develop public service announcements and newspaper articles to be released to local media outlets in an effort to increase volunteer support for Four Rivers Watershed Watch.

Increasing awareness of grant opportunities for water quality related projects is another goal identified for this project.  The basin coordinator will stay abreast of grant opportunities and available resources for water quality related projects, and will share this information with local watershed groups and citizens in an effort to improve water quality through project implementation.  The basin coordinator will meet with community leaders, school leaders, concerned citizens, businesses, industries or other potential applicants to notify them of different grant opportunities, including EPA 319(h) grants and other Clean Water Act funds, and assist them with project development and implementation to ensure ideas and concerns are turned into successful projects.  The basin coordinator will meet with local water and sewer districts to identify projects that could potential impact water quality and attempt to minimize the negative impacts on water quality.  The coordinator will also work with these districts to find potential sources of funding for projects that could enhance water quality, in addition to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.  The basin coordinator will attend the Water Management Council meetings help by the Purchase Area Development District and the Pennyrile Area Development District to stay knowledgeable on projects that could impact water quality throughout the Four Rivers Basin.

The last project goal identified for this project includes increasing the knowledge base of the basin coordinator in order to provide greater assistance to local communities and watershed groups.  The basin coordinator will attend monthly meetings with other basin coordinators in Kentucky to share experiences and information about the watershed approach, successful projects that have been implemented, and other useful information.  The basin coordinator will attend additional GIS training to become more familiar in GIS database development and applications in watershed management.  The basin coordinator will attend the Kentucky Watershed Leadership Academy training, if requested by the KDOW. The basin coordinator will attend various other water quality related training as it becomes available, such as stream and habitat restoration training, data collection training, best management practice training, communication training, etc.  Potential training opportunities will be cleared first through the KDOW to ensure they will be useful to the basin coordinator.

"233","items",NA,"NM",96405,"Ute Reservoir Watershed-Based Plan for Water Quality Restoration (Ute Reservoir WBP)","$66,604","Overview
This project will develop a WBP for Ute Reservoir and the watershed that contains it.  The areas drained by Ute Creek and the Canadian River upstream of Ute Reservoir is sparsely populated rangeland.  A third tributary, Pajarito Creek, includes some urban land in Tucumcari.  The New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (OSE), Interstate Stream Commission (ISC) owns and operates the reservoir and has the right to water stored in it.  The currently planned Ute Pipeline will convey water from Ute Reservoir and provide a long-term sustainable water supply for eastern New Mexico.  

Water quality impairments include E. coli and plant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for the Canadian River (Ute Reservoir to Conchas Reservoir, NM-2303_00, WQS 20.6.4.303) and Pajarito Creek (Canadian River to headwaters, NM-2303_10, WQS 20.6.4.303).  The TMDLs for each of the impaired water bodies includes a reduction in E. coli of 88% for the Canadian River and 84% for Pajarito Creek, a reduction in total nitrogen of 95% and total phosphorus of 99% for Pajarito Creek.  Ute Reservoir itself was not included in the latest round of TMDLs in 2015, however the reservoir was added to the Integrated List of Impairments for PCBs in fish tissue.


Objectives
Develop a draft watershed monitoring plan for identifying pollutant sources. The plan will begin with the current TMDL pollutants of concern, plant nutrients and E. coli; however, sediment and herbicides are also in the Ute Reservoir and all of these analytes will likely be included in the monitoring plan.  The Town of Tucumcari and New Mexico Department of Transportation may request additional parameters to meet its NPDES WWTP discharge and storm water regulatory requirements.  These monitoring priorities will be set in the initial actions of the watershed group.  After developing the list of concerns, project staff will draft a monitoring plan with locations, sampling frequencies and methods of analysis. this analysis and stakeholder engagement will allow the plan to develop a qualitative identification of impairment sources within the watershed.  As monitoring builds a quantitative database, self-assessment of controls and the sharpening of source identification will improve. 

Methods
Development of the WBP follows the logical sequence of an applied scientific investigation centered on identifying the pollutant control methods that will best address the water quality concerns in a cost effective and efficient manner. Some of the work is on-going from existing programs and some will be new. The Ute Reservoir WBP will organize the on-going and new efforts in a way that can be evaluated and measured by all stakeholders and public agencies. The nine basic elements of watershed planning remain the most logical way to achieve this goal.

This project will expand use of proven agricultural management practices (MPs) to growers of almonds, alfalfa, and cotton in a three-county region of the Lower San Joaquin River watershed. The Sustainable Cotton Project's (SCP) current work in this area is gaining ground and acceptance from local growers. The plan for the region cites agricultural chemical use as the main source of the pollutants chlorpyrifos and diazinon that make up the TMDL. SCP has a proven track record of reducing use of chlorpyrifos by growers of up to 70% over regional average. More growers and more acres must implement reduced-risk practices if progress is to be made in preventing pollution. Use of proven BMPs, outreach, access to UC technical specialists, and infield weekly scouting are the basis for success. Keeping the momentum going, adding new growers and additional acres, making sure these practices become the new normal is essential for real change to occurat the farm level where chemical decisions and applications are made. 

Objectives
This project gives farmers tools to reduce/eliminate use of these products year round and provides a model for other farmers and crops. Mentoring, field scouting, field days, insect releases, assistance from statewide experts, and outreach will enable a wider range of farmers to adopt reduced risk practices without simply switching materials. It is working now and with additional time, more farmers and acres will adopt BMPs helping meet watershed TMDL targets. Also, goal to reduce the use of target pesticides by 20,000 pounds annually. 

Methods
The project has a clear plan for site selection (enrolling growers and their fields that fall within the watershed area) and will build on the 2,000 acres and 25 growers already active in implementing BMPs. We will utilize fields of alfalfa and cotton and almond orchard blocks that growers enroll and will intensively track these acres which all fall within the high priority of irrigated agriculture with water that flows to the LSJ River. Working with UC researchers, UCCE extension advisors, and UC IPM area advisors, the project will implement the best known measures for reducing the use of chlorpyrifos and diazinon along with other chemicals known to cause water quality and human health issues. Our plan for attracting 10-20 new growers and their acres into the project includes a yearly recruitment fair, print and electronic media publicity, use of SCP’s popular weekly web blog, information sharing with UCCE and UC IPM, websites, Ag Fax publication that goes out to hundreds of growers each week, word of mouth, and SCP mentor growers’ personal invitations from our SCP field outreach coordinator. This project
implements appropriate management practices such as reduced-risk pesticides, rigorous scouting, and calculation of economic thresholds to determine when pest damage merits spraying, Integrated Pest Management, hedgerows, beneficial insect habitat and trap crops, sensible spraying habits, and vegetated waterways. When applied by our 30-50 enrolled growers over 3,000-5,000 acres (our newly recruited and existing enrolled growers), the practices will achieve significant water quality improvements. The appropriate BMPs for each site will be compiled on a site-by-site basis by the team from UC and SCP staff with years of experience working with California growers.","Y","Project Implementation","18040001","180400010806","N","06/30/2013","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:82525"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,"<a href=""https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/grts/GRTSADM.download_my_file?p_file=207765&p_page=PROJECT"">Lower San Joaquin River Diazinon and Chlorpyrifos TMDL</a> [Implementing Plan]","Pesticides (Dianzinon), Pathogens (Other)",483720

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields


Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) base funding will be used to support the Nutrient Management Program Manager and the Nutrient Management Training and Certification Coordinator, both based in the DCR, DSWC central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 Nutrient Management Specialists. Two full-time and one part-time nutrient management specialists will be housed in agency watershed field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement Objectives 1, 2, and 5 of the Agriculture Chapter in the Virginia Nonpoint Source Pollution Management Program Plan. .  In addition this project implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan. As directed by Federal grant guidance, these positions will not be directly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES program responsibilities. 

Program Income: : It is not anticipated that any program income will be generated from this project  If any fees or funds are generated through the Nutrient Management certification and/or training programs these will be utilized for program activities and reported to EPA at the end of the grant cycle. This is a requirement in State regulation that all money generated from NM training be used for the trainings. If program income is generated this will be identified to EPA on the Interim or Final FSR.

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields

The Klamath Tracking and Accounting Program (Klamath TAP) defines a consistent accounting system that links conservation projects to load reductions called for in both California's and Oregon's Klamath River TMDLs. The Klamath TAP goal is to increase the pace and reduce the cost of improving Klamath Basin water quality to support all beneficial uses, including recovery of native fish. This project will: 1) integrate conservation priorities from multiple federal, state and private conservation initiatives interested in the Klamath river basin, 2) tailor tools to the specific needs of the Klamath basin and expand their applicability to additional conservation practices, 3) demonstrate the use of draft protocol and expanded tools by selecting, implementing and quantifying the benefits from multiple conservation projects, and 4) launch the full program by engaging program participants through training and outreach, and formally establishing the management system defined in the draft protocol. 

Objectives
The expansion of Klamath TAP described here will address impairments to Klamath main stem and tributaries including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. Also, this project will fulfill a task identified in both California’s and Oregon’s Klamath River TMDLs: to develop and implement a basinwide water quality tracking and accounting program that would establish a framework to track water quality improvements, facilitate planning and coordinated TMDL implementation, and enable appropriate water quality offsets or trades.

Methods
Klamath TAP will occur in several steps: 
1) Site selection and eligibility. 
2) Quantification of baseline condition and post-project condition for temperature and nutrient loads.
3) Verification of reductions.
4) Calibration of load quantification tools.
5) Reporting of project data in a central database.

The goal of this long-term program is to provide objective, credible data to decision makers in the Powder basin and engage stakeholders in monitoring their watersheds.

Objectives
The ultimate purpose of the volunteer 2 year monitoring program is two-fold: to engage stakeholders in on-the-ground activities that lead to a better understanding of watershed condition, and to obtain relevant objective water quality and watershed condition data. We hope that successful volunteer engagement will extend into the long term program we envision.
Our primary goal is to establish a long-term volunteer monitoring program that provides objective, credible data to decision makers in the Powder Basin and promote stakeholder engagement in monitoring watershed condition. 
Specific monitoring objectives for the first 2 years are:
1.	Detect changes in 7 day max water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, and turbidity greater than 10% at 10 locations using continuous data.
2.	Detect exceedances in 7 day max water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, and turbidity standards at 10 locations using field data collection.
3.	Detect visual changes to stream channels, streambanks, and riparian vegetation at 25 locations through seasonal photo monitoring.


Methods
	Plan strategically, prioritizing for instream and riparian projects to maintain and improve freshwater aquatic habitats, water quality and stream flow that affect native fishes, i.e. Bull and Redband trout.
	Address the parameters that are limiting watershed function and ecological diversity.
	Identify trends (changes) in habitat conditions so that we can maximize healthy populations of plant and animal species.
	Determine how to best coordinate a monitoring program that ensures a sustainable, cooperative restoration/monitoring program covering the whole Powder Basin.
	Evaluate progress toward environmental benchmark goals.

West Fork Creek is listed on the CWA Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. The watershed (HUC 06030002-270) encompasses parts of Morgan, Cullman, and Marshall counties in the Tennessee River Basin. History of the watershed shows that streams have been straightened and cleared of vegetation (""clean-out""), to prevent flooding and allow easy access by livestock. At least 7.5 miles of this Fish and Wildlife water quality use classification stream is listed as impaired on the CWA Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. Numerous sources and causes of pollutants impair the West Fork Watershed. These include nutrient loadings from livestock and septic systems, and sedimentation from eroding stream banks, construction sites and cropland. These impairments increase levels of nutrients, bacterial counts, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen levels. In order to address impairments, several watershed protection management measures will be implemented. These include: providing additional incentives to landowners willing to participate in the USDA's Continuous Conerservation Reserve Program (CRP), installing agriculture best management practices to exclude livestock from streams; development of a GIS database to illustrate the areas where practices have been or need to be implemented in the watershed; and establishing riparian forest buffers in areas with priority buffer protection needs. In addition watershed protection information will be provided to stakeholders and project area boundary signs will be erected to educate the public on the watershed concept.

Objectives
Goal: To improve water quality within the West Fork of the Cataco Creek Watershed and delist the West Fork from the CWA Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters for sediment and pathogens.

Cataco Creek and the West Fork Cataco Creek are two of 5 stream segments within the Cataco Creek Watershed that are listed on the 303(d) list. The implementation of this small watershed project will improve Cataco and West Fork Cataco Creeks and remove them from the 303(d) list. The source listed for pollution of 5.1 miles of Cataco Creek is agriculture. The main land uses in the area are pasture grazing, hay production, row crop, poultry production and a dairy operation. The source listed for pollution of 7.5 miles of West Fork Cataco Creek is agriculture. The main land uses are pasture grazing, poultry production, hay production and silviculture. Currently there are agriculture BMP projects being installed throughout the entire watershed. This project will concentrate these BMPs in two small subwatersheds. This will make water quality improvement highly possible because of the small size of land area and number of procedures to work with. To initiate the project, local organizations will be used. These include the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Morgan County Soil and Water Conservation District, Alabama Cooperative Extension System and the Morgan County Commission. Along with the implementation of BMPs, an education program will be initated to inform the landowners about the goal of the project, what they can do to help and why they need to help. To achieve these goals, a watershed restoration plan will be developed for the project. Sediment reduction and bacterial loading reduction will be the main goal of this project.

Objectives
To reduce sediment and nutrient and bacterial sources within the two stream segments, thus taking both segments off the 303(d) list.

Methods
Streambank stabilization, conservation buffers, buffer zones, rotational grazing, stream fencing, heavy use areas, stream crossings and tree planting will be the main methods.

The SE AL Basin Assessment will provide an assessment of overall water quality and estimate the status of ecological conditions throughout the SE AL River Basins (SE AL).  This will be accomplished by monitoring watersheds (monitoring units) in proportion to an environmental index or Generalized Disturbance Gradient (GDG).  ADEM delineates monitoring units (MUs) based on 12-digit HUCs to more closely link assessment results to watershed conditions.  Monitoring watersheds in proportion to a GDG has been recently proposed as a method to limit error or bias associated with targeted sampling.  It has also been recommended by the EPA to develop Tiered Aquatic Life Uses, to correlate suspected stressors to known levels of impairment, and consequently improve the overall assessment of water quality within a basin group.  

The proposed project will provide data to develop indicators and assessment criteria that link chemical, physical, and biological conditions within a wadeable stream reach to conditions throughout the stream’s watershed.  This data can be used to develop nutrient criteria by 2012 as required by USEPA, to revise ADEM’s biological assessment criteria, and assessment methodologies to more accurately assess wadeable streams and rivers.  It will support ADEM’s Ecoregional Reference Reach Program by collecting biological, chemical, and habitat data at each of ADEM’s established Ecoregional Reference Reaches within the SE AL River Basins and by identifying and monitoring other least-impaired reaches within the basin.  

Data collected at each stream reach can be used to categorize these stream segments in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report.  It will support ADEM’s Section 303(d)/TMDL program by identifying some of the most-disturbed watersheds within the basin group. 

The project will also incorporate intensive monitoring in priority watersheds identified by ADEM’s Nonpoint Source Management Program to assess the effectiveness of BMPs implemented using Section 319 Funds.  To meet this objective, sites will be monitored at a smaller spatial scale to more fully assess specific BMPs.  Data collected at each stream reach can be used to categorize these stream segments in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report.  

 


Objectives
1: 	Estimate overall water quality and ecological conditions within the SE AL by monitoring MUs that represent the complete gradient of watershed conditions.  
2: 	Provide data that can be used to categorize each stream monitoring site in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report. 
3: 	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at each of ADEM’s established Ecoregional Reference Reaches, as well as additional sites in least-disturbed MUs, within the SE AL to support development of ecoregional reference conditions and nutrient criteria. 
4: 	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at existing 303(d)/TMDL stream segments, as well as some of the most-disturbed MUs within the SE AL to support ADEM’s Section 303(d)/TMDL and Nonpoint Source Management Programs. 
5: 	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at randomly-selected MUs representing the full range of watershed conditions within the SE AL to develop indicators that link chemical, physical, and biological conditions within a wadeable stream reach to watershed conditions, with the ultimate goal of developing nutrient criteria and revising ADEM’s biological and habitat assessment guidelines and Listing and Assessment Methodology to more accurately assess ecological conditions within each stream reach. 
6: 	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at priority watersheds identified by ADEM’s Nonpoint Source Management Program to assess the effectiveness of BMPs implemented through Alabama’s CWA Section 319 Program. 





Methods
This project will focus on assessing the flowing, wadeable watersheds or monitoring units (MUs) within the SE AL.  Habitat and biological community (macroinvertebrates, fish, periphyton) assessments and water quality data collection (in situ parameters, nutrients, chlorophyll a, pesticides/herbicides, and metals) will be conducted at: 1) sites within randomly-selected MUs representing the complete range of watershed conditions within the SE AL; 2) established ecoregional reference sites located within the SE AL; 3) sites to verify and document current conditions at 303(d)/TMDL stream segments within the SE AL; and 4) sites within watersheds selected as priorities by ADEM’s NPS Management Program.  This project represents an increase in monitoring of chemical, physical, and biological indicators to meet new requirements to the Section 319 Program, the Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report Guidance, and Alabama’s draft 2005 Listing and Assessment Methodology.   Additionally, extensive and intensive monitoring of multiple indicators over a range of watershed conditions will provide data that ADEM can use to develop nutrient criteria by EPA’s 2011 deadline.  This project will also include enhancement of the Department’s quality assurance and data management activities, as required by U.S. EPA Elements of a State Water Monitoring and Assessment Program.

 Water quality data collected through this project will provide an estimate of the current water quality and trophic state of the rivers, reservoirs, tributary embayments, and stream tributaries of all the Southeast Alabama River Basins.  

Tributary embayments of reservoirs function as the settling basin for nutrients and sediment originating upstream in the flowing portion of the tributary. With decreased shading and increased retention time, full expression of the biological impacts of excessive nutrients is often observed in this embayment portion of the watershed.  Therefore, in addition to determining the water quality of these portions of the rivers and reservoirs, determining the water quality of tributary embayments serves a dual purpose as an excellent indicator of the water quality of upstream tributaries.  Project sites will be monitored monthly through the algal growing season, April-October, for in situ parameters, nutrients, and chlorophyll a concentrations.  Water quality assessments of these nonwadeable waterbodies will serve as a complement to the assessment of wadeable streams in the project Rotational River Basin Approach: Surface Water Quality Assessment of the SE Alabama River Basin and will allow for more definitive determinations of water quality. This project will include enhancement of the Department’s quality assurance and data management activities, as required by U.S. EPA Elements of a State Water Monitoring and Assessment Program.    

The proposed water quality assessment for nutrient criteria project will provide data that will allow ADEM to develop lake-specific nutrient criteria and determine total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) as needed for a mainstem reservoir location in the Yellow River basin.  Collected data will be used for development of nutrient criteria for this waterbody.  Data will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads for this waterbody as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.  

Collected tributary embayment data will assist in the determination of tributaries most affected by nonpoint source pollution and will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads for these waterbodies as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.  Used in conjunction with future intensive monitoring within priority sub-Basin, these projects will allow ADEM to assess the effectiveness of cumulative best management practices’ implementation utilizing ecological condition trend estimations.  

Data collected by this project will also be used to update the Department’s Integrated Monitoring and Assessment Report (CWA Sections 303(d), 305(b), 314), the ADEM Water Resources System - Alabama Water-Quality Assessment & Monitoring Data Repository (for analysis and future trend determinations), and exported to EPA’s WQX database.  In addition, data collected by this study will be presented at the annual meetings of the Alabama Fisheries Association and Alabama Water Watch Program as resources allow.  



Objectives
a.	Assess the water quality and trophic state of multiple river, reservoir and tributary embayment locations in the Southeast Alabama, as well as one mainstem reservoir location in the Yellow River basin.  

Water quality assessment of the chemical, physical, and biological variables will provide data to assist in determination of reservoir tributaries most affected by nonpoint source pollution, provide data for development of lake specific water quality criteria,  and will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.

This TN River Basin Assessment will provide an assessment of overall water quality and estimate the status of ecological conditions throughout the Tennessee River basin (TN).  This will be accomplished by monitoring watersheds (monitoring units) in proportion to an environmental index or Generalized Disturbance Gradient (GDG).  ADEM delineates monitoring units (MUs) based on 12-digit HUCs to more closely link assessment results to watershed conditions.  Monitoring watersheds in proportion to a GDG has been recently proposed as a method to limit error or bias associated with targeted sampling.  It has also been recommended by the EPA to develop Tiered Aquatic Life Uses, to correlate suspected stressors to known levels of impairment, and consequently improve the overall assessment of water quality within a basin group.  

This project will also provide data to develop indicators and assessment criteria that link chemical, physical, and biological conditions within a wadeable stream reach to conditions throughout the stream’s watershed.  This data can be used to develop nutrient criteria by 2012 as required by USEPA; and revise ADEMs biological assessment criteria and assessment methodologies to more accurately assess wadeable streams and rivers.  This project will also  support ADEMs Ecoregional Reference Reach Program by collecting biological, chemical, and habitat data at each of ADEM’s established Ecoregional Reference Reaches within the TN by identifying and monitoring other least-impaired reaches.  

Data collected at each stream reach will meet minimum data requirements to categorize stream segments in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report.  It will also support ADEMs Section 303(d)/TMDL program by identifying and fully assessing some of the most-disturbed watersheds within the basin. 

The project will incorporate intensive monitoring in priority watersheds identified by ADEM’s Nonpoint Source Management Program to assess the effectiveness of BMPs implemented using Section 319 and other watershed/BMP funding.  Sites will be monitored at a smaller spatial scale to more fully assess specific BMPs.  Data collected at each stream reach will meet minimum data requirements to categorize the stream segments in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report.  


Objectives
a)	Estimate overall water quality and ecological conditions within the TN by monitoring MUs that represent the complete gradient of watershed conditions.  

b)	Provide data that can be used to categorize each stream monitoring site in Alabama’s Integrated Assessment Report. 

c)	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at each of ADEM’s established Ecoregional Reference Reaches, as well as additional sites in least-disturbed MUs, within the TN to support development of ecoregional reference conditions and nutrient criteria. 

d)	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at existing 303(d)/TMDL stream segments, as well as some of the most-disturbed MUs within the TN to support ADEM’s Section 303(d)/TMDL and Nonpoint Source Management Programs. 

e)	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at randomly-selected MUs representing the full range of watershed conditions within the TN to develop indicators that link chemical, physical, and biological conditions within a wadeable stream reach to watershed conditions, with the ultimate goal of developing nutrient criteria and revising ADEM’s biological and habitat assessment guidelines and Listing and Assessment Methodology to more accurately assess ecological conditions within each stream reach. 

f)	Collect biological, chemical, and habitat data at priority watersheds identified by ADEM’s Nonpoint Source Management Program to assess the effectiveness of CWA Section 319 BMP implementation.


Methods
This project will focus on assessing the flowing, wadeable watersheds or monitoring units (MUs) in the TN River Basin.  Habitat and biological community (macroinvertebrates, fish, periphyton) assessments and water quality data collection (in situ parameters, nutrients, chlorophyll a, pesticides/herbicides, and metals) will be conducted at TN River Basin sites: 1) within randomly-selected MUs (monitoring units) representing the complete range of watershed conditions; 2) established ecoregional reference sites; 3) sites to verify and document current conditions at 303(d)/TMDL stream segments; and 4) sites within watersheds selected as priorities by ADEM’s NPS Management Program.  This project represents an increase in monitoring of chemical, physical, and biological indicators to meet the needs of the Section 319/NPS Management Program, the Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report Guidance, and Alabama’s Listing and Assessment Methodology.   Additionally, extensive and intensive monitoring of multiple indicators over a range of watershed conditions will provide data that ADEM can use to develop nutrient criteria by EPA’s 2012 deadline.  This project will also enhance the Department’s quality assurance and data management activities as required by the U.S. EPAs “Elements of a State Water Monitoring and Assessment Program.”  Data collected during this project should also be adequate to categorize TN River Basin assessed-waters for the Alabama Integrated Assessment Report.

Water quality data collected through this project will provide an estimate of the current water quality and trophic state of the rivers, reservoirs, tributary embayments, and stream tributaries of the Tennessee River Basin.  

Tributary embayments of reservoirs function as the settling basin for nutrients and sediment originating upstream in the flowing portion of the tributary. With decreased shading and increased retention time, full expression of the biological impacts of excessive nutrients is often observed in this embayment portion of the watershed.  Therefore, in addition to determining the water quality of these portions of the rivers and reservoirs, determining the water quality of tributary embayments serves a dual purpose as an excellent indicator of the water quality of upstream tributaries.  Project sites will be monitored monthly through the algal growing season, April-October, for in situ parameters, nutrients, and chlorophyll a concentrations.  Water quality assessments of these nonwadeable waterbodies will serve as a complement to the assessment of wadeable streams in the project Surface Water Quality Screening Assessment of the Tennessee River Basin and will allow for more definitive determinations of water quality. This project will include enhancement of the Department’s quality assurance and data management activities, as required by U.S. EPA Elements of a State Water Monitoring and Assessment Program.    
 
The proposed water quality assessment for nutrient criteria project will provide data that will allow ADEM to develop lake-specific nutrient criteria and determine total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) as needed for a mainstem reservoir location in the Yellow River basin.  Collected data will be used for development of nutrient criteria for this waterbody.  Data will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads for this waterbody as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.  

Collected tributary embayment data will assist in the determination of tributaries most affected by nonpoint source pollution and will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads for these waterbodies as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.  Used in conjunction with future intensive monitoring within priority sub-Basins, these projects will allow ADEM to assess the effectiveness of cumulative best management practices’ implementation using ecological condition trend estimations.  

Data collected by this project will also be used to update the Department’s Integrated Monitoring and Assessment Report (CWA Sections 303(d), 305(b), 314), ADEM Rivers and Reservoirs Monitoring Program (RRMP) database (for analysis and future trend determinations), the ADEM Water Resources System - Alabama Water-Quality Assessment & Monitoring Data Repository (ALAWADR), and exported to EPA’s WQX database.  In addition, data collected by this study will be presented at the annual meetings of the Alabama Fisheries Association and Alabama Water Watch Program as resources allow.  


Objectives
a.	Assess the water quality and trophic state of multiple river and tributary embayment locations in the Tennessee River Basin, as well as one mainstem reservoir location in the Yellow River basin.  

Water quality assessment of the chemical, physical, and biological variables will provide data to assist in determination of reservoir tributaries most affected by nonpoint source pollution, provide data for development of lake specific water quality criteria, and will assist in the development of total maximum daily loads as required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.

Watershed Council Assessments and TMDL Implementation Plans for the Upper Willamette region state the need to identify non-point sources of pollution and to work with cities and watershed residents to improve water quality through restoration
of riparian corridors and public education and outreach. Together with Designated Management Agencies, we propose to implement a water quality monitoring program that will identify water quality pollutants and land use impacts within 8 small cities in the Upper Willamette and several agricultural and rural watersheds in the Middle and Coast Fork Willamette. These data will be used to prioritize watershed restoration activities and best management practices, to educate the public on anthropogenic impacts and activities for improving water quality. Project partners include Long Tom, Middle and Coast Fork Watershed Councils, Cities of Oakridge, Westfir, Lowell, Creswell, Cottage Grove, Veneta, Junction City and Coburg, Springfield Utility Board, Eugene DEQ, USFS, USACE and ODFW. NPS Program priorities addressed in Question 22a. 319 funds will be used for contract labor, sample processing, project and fiscal management.

Objectives
The project meets the following goals:
• Provide water quality data that each DMA can use to evaluate their relative impacts on the water quality of streams flowing through their zone of influence;
• Support the implementation of management practices that target water quality impacts identified during the monitoring phase. This may include adding management practices to the DMAs’ TMDL Implementation Plans;
• Establish baseline water quality information that may later be used to evaluate long-term trends and effectiveness of management practices implemented by each DMA and councils;
• Evaluate bacteria and nutrient concentrations in rural residential sub-watersheds of the Coast and Middle Fork Willamette that have no previous data for these constituents;
• Provide relevant, locally generated, and site specific monitoring results that support outreach and education efforts to local residents and decision makers; and
• Prioritize enhancement and restoration actions that address identified water quality problems within the DMAs and the surrounding rural areas within the Middle and Coast Fork Willamette and Long Tom watersheds.

Methods
The goals of the project are accomplished with the following objectives:
• Implement monthly ambient monitoring upstream and downstream of the 8 DMAs in the Upper Willamette and at approximately 15 sites in the Coast and Middle Fork Willamette Watersheds;
• Monitor two storm events (one/year) at the 8 DMAs;
• Collect and analyze macroinvertebrate samples at approximately 25 sites in the 8 DMAs;
• Monitor continuous temperature at up to 30 sites on Coast Fork Willamette mainstem and tributaries that have no previous data and up and downstream of some of the DMAs;
• Develop and conduct multiple workshops or public meetings within the Middle and Coast Fork Willamette and Long Tom watersheds; and
• Incorporate analysis into TMDL Implementation Plans and watershed council Action Plans.","N","Project Implementation","17090011","170900110106","N","08/29/2008","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:63220"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,107791
"273","items",NA,"AL",98363,"Alabama Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (Phase II: Coastal Alabama Onsite Septage Inspection Project)","$100,000","Overview
The State of Alabama continues to enhance implementation of its Coastal Zone Management Program under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972. The CZMA requires the state to develop and implement a Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (ACNPCP) under Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendment of 1990 (CZARA).EPA continues to encourage coastal states to use Section 319 funds to assist in the implementation of management measures contained in these programs. In addition, CZARA requires states to “implement the program, including the management measures… through changes to the state plan for control of nonpoint source pollution approved under section 319…” The ADEM NPS program staff works closely with Coastal nonpoint program staff to coordinate the Alabama Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (ACNPCP) with the statewide AL NPS Management Program. In accordance with EPA’s Nonpoint Source Program and Grant
Guidelines for States and Territories (2013, ADEM continues to set aside a portion of the Section 319 grant to align and integrate the statewide NPS program with efforts to meet EPA/NOAA coastal program interim decision document recommendations and obtain final EPA/NOAA approval the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program.
Implementation of the ACNPCP is required by CZARA Section 6217 to be implemented through the AL NPS Management Program administered under CWA Section 319, as well as through updates to the state’s coastal zone management program. Alabama has not yet completed development of an approvable ACNPCP. In accordance with Section 319 grant guidelines, ADEM sets aside, at a minimum, the lesser amount of five percent of its federal allocation or $100,000 annually to complete the development of an approvable program. This requirement may be met on an average annual basis; for example, the state may commit triple the state’s annual minimum set-aside in one grant year in order to meet the set-aside requirements for the following two grant years (provided Section 319 funding allocations do not significantly increase in those years). Regardless of the method of allocation, coastal program set-aside funding will be in place until EPA and NOAA have fully approved the ACNPCP.
The wide array of ways in which Section 319 funds may be used to support NPS management activities makes them well-suited to integration with other program funds, especially those limited to a specific set of activities such as BMP implementation. The integration of the statewide and coastal NPS programs in Alabama is designed to strengthen the links between the design and implementation of water quality-focused projects while coordinating and leveraging the resources, authorities, and expertise of relevant programs. In this manner, the state ensures that the coastal NPS program (and other relevant baseline programs) is consistent with the statewide CWA Section 319 program.

Methods
This project is designed to directly and expeditiously help ADEM achieve goals, objectives and milestones of the AL NPS Management Program. Resources provided by this project will be used to collaborate, cooperate and communicate with the state’s coastal nonpoint pollution control program pursuant to Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 (CZARA). CZARA requires states to “implement the program, including the management measures… through changes to the state plan for control of nonpoint source pollution approved under Section 319…” This project supports relevant resource agency and public and private sectors efforts to continually address remaining EPA/NOAA findings-document conditional approvals. This cooperative statewide and coastal nonpoint program project is expected to:
a) Link OSDS project deliverables to quantifiable water quality outcomes to the maximum extent practicable
b) Strengthen working partnerships and linkages with appropriate OSDS resource agencies and other entities
c) Integrate the statewide and coastal NPS / OSDS programs to ensure expeditious progress in achieving state water quality standards and restoring watershed health.

"274","items",NA,"NC",50016,"I-6 Technical Assistance for the Nonpoint Source Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Strategies","$326,435","Overview
Full-time conservation technicians were established through funding provided by EPA 319 and the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The positions are needed to provide continued technical assistance to local citizens to implement the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico TMDLs and compile yearly-required reports. Providing additional technical assistance is desirable for natural resource conservation planning, landowner education on NPS pollutants, and the design, installation, and maintenance of agricultural best management practices and stormwater controls to achieve the desired nutrient loading goals in all three watersheds.

NC DWQ recognizes the need for conservation technicians in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins for assisting residents to implement and maintain nutrient reductions. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation will work cooperatively with each of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (districts), the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other state and federal partners to ensure success. Conservation technicians are county employees with offices located in local SWCD offices.  Specific duties of each conservation technician include outreach to residents, education, and installation and maintenance of agricultural and urban best management practices.
Watershed technician positions are needed in districts in order to assure consistent reporting for the agricultural rules in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  During the course of this project, the number of technicians employed in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins has been reduced to insure efficient use of funding, while still being able to provide valuable technical assistance and complete annual reporting activities. Where position technicians were not able to obtain additional local or state funding, districts have entered in contracts to receive small annual payments that are less expensive than the cost of a full-time technician, but still provide reporting assistance to the Local Advisories Committees.  

It is important to note that the agricultural rule strategies depend upon local advisory committees to complete annual reporting requirements to insure compliance and report progress with the goals of the rule.  The funding requested in this grant will allow for a coordinated system of annual reporting and focus on rule implementation, as there were no funds provided for local staff positions to assist in rule implementation.  These staff positions and contracts allow the State to receive consistent information from each county.  Although the local advisory committee members are appointed, they serve as volunteers.  Without local staff coordination, obtaining the most up-to-date and accurate information from 30 counties would be infeasible.  

The primary objective of this project is to employ fulltime conservation technicians to provide technical assistance to local citizens and landowners in natural resource conservation planning and best management practice (BMP) implementation to help meet the Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) strategies in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  Accelerated technical assistance is beneficial for natural resource conservation planning and BMP design, installation, and maintenance.  Having staff available locally to do this important work has helped agricultural operations achieve their nutrient reduction goals collectively in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  
 
The Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and the USDA-NRCS staff provide technical information, engineering assistance, and oversight of BMP installation.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation (DSWC) works with the districts using the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program (ACSP) infrastructure to provide SWCDs with matching salary funds for these technicians and for BMP contracts in these river basins.  

In December 1997, the EMC adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy (15A NCAC 2B.0238).  For the first time in state history, river basin rules were applied to agricultural nonpoint sources. The strategy is aimed at reducing the nitrogen load to the Neuse River Estuary from agricultural nonpoint sources by a minimum of 30 percent of the average annual load from the period 1991-1995 by August 2003.  The nitrogen reduction goal and management measures stated in the strategy also are mirrored in the TMDL for the Neuse Estuary.  The TMDL was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 2001.  The TMDL calls for continuing to implement the Neuse NSW Management Strategy.

A total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Pamlico Estuary was approved in 1995 based on a two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic model of the estuary from Greenville to Pamlico Point. The TMDL requires a 30% reduction in total nitrogen and no net increase in total phosphorus loading from the 1991 baseline year (DEM 1994). Since 1991, a voluntary program for agricultural nitrogen reduction has been underway resulting in approximately one-third of the cropland treated with nutrient reducing best management practices. In 1998, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) determined that agriculture had not made sufficient progress toward implementation of the TMDL and nutrient reduction targets. After a rulemaking process involving stakeholders and a legislative negotiation, Session Law 2001-355 was passed in 2001. The agricultural nutrient control strategy for the Tar-Pamlico was adopted by the EMC as 15A NCAC 2B .0256.  The session law and the rule require agricultural nutrient reductions according to the TMDL by September 1, 2006.  

Another important role of the watershed technician is implementing community conservation practices, and providing technical assistance and educational opportunities for all ages.  The technicians will be capable of designing and supervising the installation of basic stormwater BMPs such as grass swales, rain gardens, and stormwater wetland projects.  They will also have the opportunity to educate landowners, homeowner associations and school-aged children on the sources and effects of NPS pollution.   

The long-term objective of this proposal is to actively engage the technicians with local governments and Soil and Water Conservation Districts in addressing their nonpoint source pollution concerns.  Through education and outreach programs as well as technical assistance to all landowners, these technicians should become a vital asset to the counties they serve.  Demonstrating these technicians’ attributes to their host County will be a crucial element in achieving the local governments continual funding of the position.   There are some counties that have not been able to support a technician based on the limited funding available through the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program.  For those counties, we will enter into a service contract to insure that the nutrient strategy work is done and that each county is promoting nutrient management practices.  These contracts will allow all necessary data to be compiled for the required annual report at a lesser cost than hiring a full time technician.


Objectives
The local river basin technicians (319 currently supports 6 of the 7 positions depicted below) will be instrumental in working with citizens to learn more about nutrient reduction and encourage additional installation of best management practices. The three main categories of work they will do include: 
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.
2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies.
3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

 

These staff positions will have additional responsibilities, as described below:

	Coordinate efforts with other agency personnel to work in accordance with the Local Nutrient Reduction Strategy developed by LACs for the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

Watershed Technicians have a significant role in conservation planning, developing cost share contracts, and writing nutrient management plans.  The role of technicians working with farmers to plan and install BMPs has increased due to limiting staffing and significant conservation funding.  The watershed technicians have been instrumental in accelerating BMP design and installation since they have been employed.  When looking at data since the baseline periods of the three strategies, the State’s Agriculture Cost Share Program has provided substantial support for BMP implementation.  Since 1992, a total of $24,099,930 has been spent through the NC Agricultural Cost Share program in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  This has resulted in 338,745 acres affected by BMPs, 4,900,138 pounds of N saved, 1,159,653 pounds of P saved and 1,157,774 tons of soil saved. The need for continued focus and BMP implementation in these basins is justified by the water quality monitoring data the state collects, which still indicates impairment.  


Methods
The measurable results of this project will be acres affected by BMPs, the tons of soil saved, and the pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus saved through the NC Agricultural Cost Share Program. Many of the farmers in the three watersheds participate in state and federal cost share programs.  All cost share programs require a landowner contribution to receive state or federal assistance, and many farmers install best management practices without government assistance.

The number of BMPs installed and the number of landowners participating in the project will measure the success of this project.  

An additional measurable result will be receiving the yearly annual reporting data from each local advisory committee so that each Basinwide annual report can be compiled
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.

2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies. This includes the annual county reports produced by technicians that when compiled for the basin or watershed, provide a comprehensive summary of estimated nitrogen losses from cropland based on the Nutrient Loss Estimation Worksheet. Reports show progress by county toward achieving the 30% nitrogen reduction goal for both the Neuse and the Tar-Pamlico. In counties where the goal has already been achieved, technicians will track continued compliance and maintenance of the goal. Where progress is below goal expectations, technicians will work with farmers and agency representatives to determine likely opportunities for reductions and target technical and cost-share assistance where needed.

3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

Full-time conservation technicians were established through funding provided by EPA 319 and the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The positions are needed to provide continued technical assistance to local citizens to implement the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico TMDLs and compile yearly-required reports. Providing additional technical assistance is desirable for natural resource conservation planning, landowner education on NPS pollutants, and the design, installation, and maintenance of agricultural best management practices and stormwater controls to achieve the desired nutrient loading goals in all three watersheds.

NC DWQ recognizes the need for conservation technicians in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins for assisting residents to implement and maintain nutrient reductions. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation will work cooperatively with each of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (districts), the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other state and federal partners to ensure success. Conservation technicians are county employees with offices located in local SWCD offices.  Specific duties of each conservation technician include outreach to residents, education, and installation and maintenance of agricultural and urban best management practices.

Objectives
Watershed technician positions are needed in districts in order to assure consistent reporting for the agricultural rules in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  During the course of this project, the number of technicians employed in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins has been reduced to insure efficient use of funding, while still being able to provide valuable technical assistance and complete annual reporting activities. Where position technicians were not able to obtain additional local or state funding, districts have entered in contracts to receive small annual payments that are less expensive than the cost of a full-time technician, but still provide reporting assistance to the Local Advisories Committees.  

It is important to note that the agricultural rule strategies depend upon local advisory committees to complete annual reporting requirements to insure compliance and report progress with the goals of the rule.  The funding requested in this grant will allow for a coordinated system of annual reporting and focus on rule implementation, as there were no funds provided for local staff positions to assist in rule implementation.  These staff positions and contracts allow the State to receive consistent information from each county.  Although the local advisory committee members are appointed, they serve as volunteers.  Without local staff coordination, obtaining the most up-to-date and accurate information from 30 counties would be infeasible.  

The primary objective of this project is to employ fulltime conservation technicians to provide technical assistance to local citizens and landowners in natural resource conservation planning and best management practice (BMP) implementation to help meet the Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) strategies in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  Accelerated technical assistance is beneficial for natural resource conservation planning and BMP design, installation, and maintenance.  Having staff available locally to do this important work has helped agricultural operations achieve their nutrient reduction goals collectively in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  
 
The Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and the USDA-NRCS staff provide technical information, engineering assistance, and oversight of BMP installation.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation (DSWC) works with the districts using the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program (ACSP) infrastructure to provide SWCDs with matching salary funds for these technicians and for BMP contracts in these river basins.  

In December 1997, the EMC adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy (15A NCAC 2B.0238).  For the first time in state history, river basin rules were applied to agricultural nonpoint sources. The strategy is aimed at reducing the nitrogen load to the Neuse River Estuary from agricultural nonpoint sources by a minimum of 30 percent of the average annual load from the period 1991-1995 by August 2003.  The nitrogen reduction goal and management measures stated in the strategy also are mirrored in the TMDL for the Neuse Estuary.  The TMDL was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 2001.  The TMDL calls for continuing to implement the Neuse NSW Management Strategy.

A total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Pamlico Estuary was approved in 1995 based on a two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic model of the estuary from Greenville to Pamlico Point. The TMDL requires a 30% reduction in total nitrogen and no net increase in total phosphorus loading from the 1991 baseline year (DEM 1994). Since 1991, a voluntary program for agricultural nitrogen reduction has been underway resulting in approximately one-third of the cropland treated with nutrient reducing best management practices. In 1998, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) determined that agriculture had not made sufficient progress toward implementation of the TMDL and nutrient reduction targets. After a rulemaking process involving stakeholders and a legislative negotiation, Session Law 2001-355 was passed in 2001. The agricultural nutrient control strategy for the Tar-Pamlico was adopted by the EMC as 15A NCAC 2B .0256.  The session law and the rule require agricultural nutrient reductions according to the TMDL by September 1, 2006.  

Another important role of the watershed technician is implementing community conservation practices, and providing technical assistance and educational opportunities for all ages.  The technicians will be capable of designing and supervising the installation of basic stormwater BMPs such as grass swales, rain gardens, and stormwater wetland projects.  They will also have the opportunity to educate landowners, homeowner associations and school-aged children on the sources and effects of NPS pollution.   

The long-term objective of this proposal is to actively engage the technicians with local governments and Soil and Water Conservation Districts in addressing their nonpoint source pollution concerns.  Through education and outreach programs as well as technical assistance to all landowners, these technicians should become a vital asset to the counties they serve.  Demonstrating these technicians’ attributes to their host County will be a crucial element in achieving the local governments continual funding of the position.   There are some counties that have not been able to support a technician based on the limited funding available through the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program.  For those counties, we will enter into a service contract to insure that the nutrient strategy work is done and that each county is promoting nutrient management practices.  These contracts will allow all necessary data to be compiled for the required annual report at a lesser cost than hiring a full time technician.


Methods
The local river basin technicians (319 currently supports 6.5 positions) will be instrumental in working with citizens to learn more about nutrient reduction and encourage additional installation of best management practices. The three main categories of work they will do include: 
1. Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.
2. Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies.
3. Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

The local river basin technicians currently support the following counties:
 Michael Dupree: Upper Neuse/Falls Lake/Upper Tar in Durham, Person, Orange & Granville Counties
Charles Dunevant: Upper Neuse/Falls Lake/Upper Tar in Wake, Franklin, Vance & Warren Counties
Josh Pate: Mid Neuse/Mid Tar in Nash, Halifax & Wilson Counties
Andy Miller: Mid Neuse in Johnston & Wayne Counties
Paul (PJ) Andrews: Mid Neuse/Mid Tar in Pitt, Martin, & Lenoir Counties
Brandon Marshall: Lower Tar in Hyde, Beaufort & Washington Counties
Caroline Sisley: Lower Neuse in Jones County (only ½ time support)
The Edgecombe, Greene, Carteret, Pamlico & Craven are supported by contracts because they are unable to support a full time technician.

These staff positions will have additional responsibilities, as described below:

 Coordinate efforts with other agency personnel to work in accordance with the Local Nutrient Reduction Strategy developed by LACs for the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.
 Implement the local strategy for the counties they serve and address incomplete items and conditional actions. 
 Complete NLEW runs for the annual report, spreadsheets for BMPs installed, and update local strategies each May. For strategies below the goal, develop and implement a plan for achieving goals. 
 Organize and participate in LAC meetings in coordination with LAC chair and district staff. 
 Document nutrient reducing BMPs. 
 Attend many of the Soil and Water Conservation District meetings and County Planning Meetings, where applicable, in each county to keep them informed of progress towards the nutrient reduction goals. 
 Work effectively with landowners, farmers and contractors in the installation of best management practices.
 Attend training provided through NRCS and others to learn how to install and plan nutrient reducing BMPs, complete the necessary training to become a Certified Nutrient Management Planner, and work towards becoming a Certified Conservation Planner. 
 Provide technical assistance to landowners to implement community conservation practices on their properties.
 Conduct outreach and environmental education programs.
 Contact landowners to advise them of regulatory requirements in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, options for complying with requirements, and opportunities available to assist in installation of nutrient reduction practices. 
 Collect information necessary to develop individual conservation farm plans for nutrient reduction in accordance with local, state and federal rules and policy, using standards and specifications of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Natural Resources Conservation Service or those adopted by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  
 Work with the District Conservationist or department head and other staff members to complete farm plans and write nutrient management plans.
 Incorporate existing and new federal and state cost share assistance programs in planning for best management practice implementation.  Assist with writing contracts and BMP planning with guidance of District Conservationist or department head.          
 Prepare necessary records and quarterly reports on work accomplished; maintain field office records and case files as required.

The need for continued focus and BMP implementation in these basins is justified by the water quality monitoring data the state collects, which still indicates impairment.  In 2008-2010 there were BMPs installed with the help of the local river basin technicians which total $5,673,765 and covering 690,642 acres.  The counties’ requests for BMP funds continually exceed the monies available each year.  This is evidence of the continual need by farmers for BMPs in this region.

Watershed restoration and protection development, assessment, and planning is needed in the Missouri River Basin to address a variety of water quality and water resource concerns including Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL), protection of public water supplies, and protection and restoration of wetlands and riparian habitats. 

The designated uses for the watershed include: aquatic life support; primary contact recreation; secondary contact recreation; food procurement; and public water supply. The primary pollutants in Atchison County State Lake, Brown County State Lake, Sabetha City Lake, Hiawatha City Lake, Troy Fair Lake, Lansing City Lake, Atchison City Lake, and in Wyandotte County Lake is lake eutrophication, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, and excess biomass, fecal coliform and siltation. Pollutants include fecal coliform bacteria in Wolf River, South Fork Big Nemaha River and other watershed streams. All rivers and lakes not meeting their designated uses require Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).


Objectives
The goal is to protect, enhance, and restore the water quality of the Missouri River Basin. A Missouri River Basin Watershed and Restoration Strategy (WRAPS) process will be used for the development, assessment and planning of strategies to reduce pollution in TMDL areas and the watershed overall. 

The creation of an action plan to restore the health of water bodies that do not meet their water quality standards, and insure those water bodies that do meet their water quality standards are protected will be completed as the final product at the end of the WRAPS process.

A Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) will be the process used in this project. The process includes engaging watershed stakeholders to: identify local issues and concerns related to water quality and other natural resources; determine the condition of these resources; identifying sources impacting these resources; establishing goals; identifying best management practices to achieve the goals; and developing an implementation plan to apply best management practices. A final report that documents the WRAPS process, goals and action plan will be the final product.  


Methods
A Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) process will be utilized to create an action plan for the watershed. This involves four phases of activities: development, assessment, planning and implementation.

This proposal will start with the development phase of the WRAPS process. The development phase will bring people together to address the issues in this watershed. 

The activities will include identifying and inviting the local producers and stakeholders to be partners in this project; establishing a local management team to guide the process; develop a plan for public education and participation through the whole process of developing the WRAPS action plan; identifying watershed issues and concerns with stakeholder input; and development of preliminary restoration and protecting goals for the watershed.

The Missouri River Basin WRAPS project began when the Glacial Hills Resource Conservation & Development Region Inc. was awarded a Development Grant from the KDHE in 2007. A Coordinator for the Missouri River Basin WRAPS project was
hired in September 2007 to guide the development of the WRAPS planning effort in the basin, and to work with stakeholders. Individuals with an interest in water resources in the Missouri River Basin watersheds have been meeting and began completing the process of identifying water-related issues in the basin in September, 2007.

The mission of the Missouri River Basin WRAPS is to provide the framework for the implementation of water quality improvement practices through technical,
informational, educational, and financial assistance. The goal is to restore the watershed to a condition with clean water, healthy habitats, and open spaces for human and wildlife communities. The aim is to make the watershed a place where people work together to sustain mutual economic and environmental well being.

A list of 25 watershed issues of concern was developed during several meetings and was finally narrowed to include the following: TMDLs/Water Quality, Sediment, Riparian Area Mgt., Livestock Mgt., Pesticide and Nutrient Mgt., Aquatic Life /Stream Biology, Poorly Sited/Poorly Constructed/Abandoned Wells, Urban Runoff, Recreational Opportunities, Lake Eutrophication, Failing Septic Systems, Wetland Mgt., Floodplain Mgt., and Public Water Supplies.

Significant portions that are included in the Development Plan include existing watershed conditions reports for the Tarkio-Wolf, South Fork of the Big Nemaha, and Independence – Sugar Creek Watersheds. 

The group discussed the composition of the Missouri River Basin WRAPS Stakeholder Leadership Team. The members will be comprised of the following: one member livestock production; one member cropland production; one member conservation districts; one member watershed districts; one member forestry/fish/wildlife; one local government (city, county); one member outreach and education; one environmental at large; and one public water supply.

The stream TMDLs this project will address include Wolf River for bacteria, biology (sediment); South Fork of the Big Nemaha River for bacteria, biology (sediment); Illinois Creek for selenium; Turkey Creek for atrazine; and Walnut Creek for bacteria. Lake TMDLs include Brown Co. State Lake for eutrophication; Atchison State Lake for eutrophication; Pony Creek Lake for eutrophication; Wyandotte Co. Lake for eutrophication; Hiawatha City Lake for eutrophication; Troy Fair Lake for eutrophication; Sabetha City Lake for eutrophication; Big Eleven Lake for eutrophication; Lansing City Lake for eutrophication. 
Impaired waters include Turkey Creek – copper; Walnut Creek – atrazine; Roys Creek – copper, zinc; Sabetha City Lake – atrazine; Atchison State Lake – atrazine, pH, copper; 
Jerry’s Lake – eutrophication; Atchison City Lake - eutrophication. 

Surface water quality in the South Fork of the Big Nemaha watershed (HUC 10240007) is generally in poor condition with over half of the stream and river segments not meeting their designated uses. The primary pollutant concern is fecal coliform bacteria and insufficient water flow. Insufficient flow can cause the stream to have a high temperature, low dissolved oxygen and increase pollutant concentrations. Groundwatere is generally in good condition with naturally occurring minerals and nitrate as the primary pollutant concerns. 

The surface water quality for the Wolf River watershed is generally in fair to poor condition with majority of the surface water bodies not supporting their designated uses. The primary pollutant concerns are fecal coliform bacteria and Ammonia. Ammonia is a chemical that is toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Potential sources of ammonia include livestock, septic systems, wildlife and wastewater facilities. The primary pollutant concerns for lakes/wetlands areas are eutrophication, excess biomass, dissolved oxygen and atrazine. 

Other water quality and water resource concerns include Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL); protection of public water supplies, fishing and recreation lakes; and protection and restoration of wetlands and riparian habitats. Specific issues include sedimentation, nutrient management, fecal coliform bacteria contamination, pesticide contamination, household hazardous wastes, unplugged water wells, and point sources of pollution. 


Objectives
1. Complete an assessment of the water quality and water resource concerns in the watershed. 
 
2. Develop a plan of action to address the water quality issues identified in the assessment phase. 

3. Develop and implement an Education and Outreach program incuding educating the public on the water quality issues and best management practices to address those issues, developing and printing educational materials, and hosting tours and workshops. 

4. Implement a demonstration best management practice for streambank stabilization and protection in a high priority area. 

Addressing these watershed issues will include reduction of sediment loads to streams and lakes by stabilization of streambanks and reduction of erosion from cropland and grassland; reduction of phosphorus levels in streams and major lakes in the watershed; reduction of bacterial contamination of water from human and livestock wastes; reduction of pesticide contamination from both urban and agricultural sources; establishment of household hazardous waste programs for the entire Missouri River Basin watershed area; protection of public and private groundwater supplies. 


Methods
1. Complete an assessment of the water quality and water resource concerns in the watershed. This would include compiling existing information that will support stakeholder concerns and known impairments in the watershed. Watershed modeling by KDHE will be used to identify areas where implementation practices will be most effective. Identify high priority areas in the watershed including TMDLs, sources of sediment, water quantity, degraded streams, on-site wastewater, nutrient loading, livestock management and abandoned wells. 

2. Develop a plan of action to address the water quality issues identified in the assessment phase. 
The development of a Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) plan is to identify major water quality concerns in the watershed. The process of identifying and prioritizing water issues in the Missouri River Basin began in September, 2007 with the first of many public meetings. Over the course of several months, local stakeholders engaged in a series of discussions that resulted in an extensive list of water quality concerns. This will all be documented in the Development Report. During the Assessment and Planning phase the existing water quality data will be researched and compiled for the watershed to aid stakeholders in determining what water concerns are supported by the available data. This process allows the Stakeholder Leadership Team to broaden their overall understanding of local water quality problems. It also will provide the following:
- Identification of data gaps – Identification of some issues as true problems, their sources and pinpointing where problems were most severe was sometimes difficult because the data to support definitive conclusions was lacking or inconclusive. These gaps can be filled by additional monitoring and modeling or, in some cases, compilation and analysis of data that does exist but that is not in a format that could be easily used for comparison and decision-making purposes.
- Comparison of perceptions of water quality problems to water quality data – Individual perceptions of watershed problems are not always supported by the facts. Some issues may seem to be larger or smaller problems than they actually are, depending on the amount of information an individual may have. In some cases this may be because of data gaps, or simply because the perception does not fit reality. In other cases, issues that were not considered significant were shown by available data to indeed be serious problems.
- Stakeholders’ awareness of water quality problems will be expanded. As various water quality concerns are addressed, individuals who were unaware of some of the issues, or who have narrow interests in water quality, will be exposed to a whole range of concerns, thus broadening their awareness.
- A big picture view of the whole watershed will be developed. Rural/urban, natural/human, and private/public interests and impacts on water quality problems will be explored. How each element affects specific areas within the watershed, impacts on surface vs. groundwater, along with economic and social factors at the root of individual issues will be explored. A more holistic understanding of the social, cultural, economic, scientific and historic factors impacting the watershed will be developed.

After months of discussion and examination of the data, a better understanding of the status of water quality in the Missouri River Basin Watershed will take shape. The plan would assist stakeholders to restore the health of water bodies that do not meet their designated uses, and insure those water bodies that do meet their designated uses are protected from degradation. 

The plan will identify priority water bodies, set watershed goals, and identify actions, costs, best management practices, and technical assistance needed to accomplish those goals. An array of best management practices, educational and informational activities and other practices designed to address these issues and goals will be developed and prioritized. The plan will be completed by the WRAPS Coordinator and Stakeholder Leadership Team by August 2009.

3. Develop and implement an Education and Outreach program to inform and educate the public on the water quality issues and best management practices to address those issues, developing and printing educational materials, and hosting tours and workshops. News articles, public meetings and tours will be utilized to inform and educate the public about assessment and planning activities. The public will be encouraged to participate in all activities of the project.

The information and education activities would seek to raise awareness about the Missouri River Basin watershed, the WRAPS project and water quality problems in the watershed. Understanding how watersheds work, that we are all members of a watershed community, and that everyone has a role to play in protecting and restoring watershed resources is important in raising awareness. Deliverables will include: 
- Four newspaper articles  
- At least one article or insert with each Conservation District and Extension newsletter 
- One brochure will be developed
- One fact sheet on watershed issues
- Website
- Field tours

Wherever possible, existing materials, delivery mechanisms and information will be used. Many agencies in northeast Kansas have experience of providing excellent outreach and assistance to residents. Additional effort to reach specific audiences with information about WRAPS issues and refocusing of existing programs to address priority issues will be necessary in some cases. In other instances, entirely new materials and outreach may be needed. 

The conservation districts will be encouraged to include news articles about the Missouri River Basin WRAPS in their annual newspaper conservation editions. 

The Buffer Coordinator in Doniphan County will provide assistance in promoting buffers and alternative locations out of riparian areas for livestock operations. They will provide information about other watershed issues of sedimentation from streambank erosion, flooding and nutrient management and stream degradation. 

4. Implement a demonstration best management practice for streambank stabilization and protection in a high priority area. 
The focus will be on a high priority area with TMDLs to address stakeholder needs and concerns. Provide cost share to a landowner on a stream bank stabilization project. KAWS will provide assistance in the planning and implementation of demonstration project.

Project Management and Oversight: Grassroots involvement of local stakeholders and groups who live or work in the watershed will form the leadership management team that will identify water quality and quantity problems, develop solutions to achieve water quality goals and a plan to implement best management practices needed and funding required. Project management and oversight will be provided by the stakeholder leadership team, WRAPS Coordinator and local stakeholders to assure all goals are reached. 

The Missouri River Basin WRAPS Coordinator will assist the leadership management team with organizing monthly meetings and other events, provide meeting summaries, coordinate with local, state and federal partners in providing technical assistance, lead the stakeholders through the watershed assessment and planning phases, assist with grant reports and involve the public in education events.

The water qualityproblems and issues that No-till on the Plains (NTOP) will addressincludes sedimentation and nutrient run-off and the reclamation of grazinglands.  A contributing factor to this problem is the poor management ofsome of the existing farming practices.  For instance, the term no-tillis commonly used to broadly define a specific seeding operation.  This generic term is accepted by many who donot understand its true definition.   This lends to the issue ofa lack of a consistent message.  

NTOP consistently worksto enhance the overall quality of continuous no-till (CNT).  It is NTOP'sbelief and the belief of many scientists who we work with that even with thecurrent yields exceeding those of intensively-tilled crops (conventional-tillage),we have yet to achieve the potential of the CNT system.  This is true for many facets of the system asa whole which includes profitability, environmental impact, and benefits tosociety.   Additional information onthe factors concerning a consistent message and the understanding of a CNT systemhas been discussed in greater details in the History and Project Information section of thisapplication.



Objectives
It is No-till on the Plains’ goal to instructnot only producers but the general public about the benefits of continuousno-till that affect producers’ profits, society, our environment and specificallywater quality. Producers must possess the management skills and techniques tooperate this holistic system; without that thorough understanding they willnever reap the benefits that this system can reward to them.  Proper management of the system includes theuse of residue (armor for the soil), nutrient, and pest management and whenappropriate, the use of buffers.

Fecal coliform bacteria, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment are significant threats to water quality in Kansas and these concerns are reflected in the WRAPS plans in this service area.  Livestock on pastureland, grazingland and animal feeding operations are contributors to pollutant impairments that occur in surface water.  It is crucial that best management practices (BMPs) related to livestock are implemented at the farm site in order to restore and protect water quality.

The key to addressing livestock-related water quality problems rests with changing producer behavior or farm management actions.  Behavior change in agriculture involves raising awareness of issues and problems, identifying options for action, securing technical and financial assistance, and implementing change.  

The Watershed Specialist process works to:

- build trust relationships with producers and landowners,

- increase awareness and change in attitudes,

- develop producer knowledge and skills,

- increase capability and provide technical assistance and training, and

- facilitate implementation of BMPs.

The Watershed Specialist is on the front line of behavioral and management decisions, implementing the full component of activities necessary to accomplish water quality improvement changes related to livestock pollution.  Management changes are the core of all BMP success.  A poorly designed facility, if managed correctly, will not necessarily create a pollution potential; while a well designed and constructed facility if not managed well can be a significant pollution potential. The Watershed Specialist collaborates with WRAPS to address water quality problems and accomplish a variety of changes in the watershed to restore and protect water quality.

The Watershed Specialist also addresses serious confinement livestock problems in the watershed by responding to KDHE livestock referrals regarding specific operations with Significant Pollution Potential.  The Watershed Specialist assists the producer to develop a plan for BMPs to correct the pollution potential, and prepare the appropriate registration and KDHE permit application.   KDHE reviews the plan for BMPs to address the problems and proceeds with the producer.  Frequently the producer implements all the recommended practices without choosing to apply for cost share. Through this process, all parties are winners.  Producers have assistance in installing approved BMPs, KDHE has met pollution concerns and corrected them, and water quality in the watershed is restored or protected.

Watershed Specialists work in collaboration with WRAPS to address water quality problems as identified in the objectives and methods below.  A great amount of experience and expertise is required to be successful in facilitating changes that make a real difference for water quality in the watersheds across Kansas.


Objectives

The Missouri River Basin WRAPS is completing the Assessment and Planning phase and the plan was prepared for submission in early summer. Consequently new guidelines were provided for the EPA 9 Element Watershed Plan and the plan is now being revised. 

The Missouri Basin WRAPS conducted extensive outreach efforts to identify and encourage local citizens to participate in the strategic planning process for the restoration and preservation of the Missouri River Basin watersheds.  From the interested citizens, a consistently reliable group of 12 to 14 concerned citizens attend and participate in monthly planning and evaluation meetings.  A Stakeholder Leadership Team has been identified to take a leadership role in decision making and implementation of plans and strategies.  Issues pertaining to the quality of the watershed were identified and, after extensive discussion, were prioritized to establish goals and BMP's for Basin rehabilitation and preservation.

A Watershed Assessment was completed of the main-stem of the Wolf River from the headwaters north of Powhatan to the confluence of the Missouri River.  The assessment identified all potential animal feeding operations, evaluated the land adjacent to and within 100 feet of the river, identified riparian areas in need of restoration and protection, identified eroding streambanks and identified major channelized reaches along the main stem of the Wolf River.  A preliminary report was presented to the Stakeholder Leadership Team in April, 2008 and a  draft final report was delivered in November of 2009.  The data collected is this assessment was used in identifying and quantifying the BMPS proposed in the Watershed Plan, Goal and Objectives.

The Stakeholder Leadership Team have reviewed and discussed a number of resources in identifying and prioritizing Watershed issues, and preparing the Watershed Plan, Goals and Objectives.  These have included: 

1.    The ""Waterbody/Assessment Unit Reports"" prepared by KDHE for each of the TMDL's identified in the Basin Watersheds.  These include extensive data on the conditions of the water body, sources of contamination, and proposed implementation activities to reduced the TMDL's.

2.     The ""Preliminary Results of the Wolf River Watershed Assessment"" prepared by KAWS in conjunction with Jeff Neel       of the Blue Earth.
3.   ""The Kansas Water Plan"" prepared by the Kansas Water Office.
4.    Presentation ""Lake Eutorphication in the Missouri Basin"" by Tom Stiles, KDHE-BOW-WPS.
5.    Presentation ""Missouri Basin Wraps - Summary of TMDLS"" by Tom Stiles, KDHE-BOW-WPS.
6.    Extensive experience and knowledge of the participating members and Stakeholder Leadership Team.
7.    The Delaware River Watershed Recovery and Protection Strategy Plan.
8.    A Watershed Conditions Report for the State of Kansas Huc 10240005 (Wolf-Tarkio WateEutrophicationnbsp;   A Watershed Conditions Report for the State of Kansas HUC 1230007 (South Fork Big Nemaha Watershed).
10.  A Watershed Conditions Report for the State of Kansas HUC 1230008 (Big Nevada Watershed).
11.  A Watershed Conditions Report for the State of Kansas HUC 1230011 (Independence Sugar Watershed).

The Missouri River Basin WRAPS has been in the Assessment and Planning Phase.  We have focused on establishing a group of concerned, interested, and involved citizens and agency representatives; collecting and analyzing information; identifying and discussing issues and prioritizing the watershed issues; and preparing a set of Goals and Objectives for the Missouri River Basin Watersheds.

The Missouri River Basin WRAPS received $10,000 to conduct a stream bank stabilization demonstration project.  We have visited and analyzed 6 potential sites and completed preliminary cost estimates and conceptual designs for 3 sites.  We have completed two grant requests for additional money and are continuing try to locate funding to complete these three sites.  We will complete at least one demonstration site this fiscal year.  The amount of sediment load reduction will depend on the site(s) selected.

Teachers and students in the Industrial Technology and Agricultural Education and FFA Departments will complete all drafting, wiring, carpentry, and welding activities. Teachers and students in the Art Department will complete all exterior design and painting activities. Once fabricated, the Districts will supply the laboratory with equipment they own, including: mini laptop computers, Vernier probe ware, Global Water water-quality monitoring probes (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH) and radio transmitter, GPA units, and microscopes. 

Objectives
One objective that can be measured and accomplished during the project period (15 months) is the actual fabrication of the mobile water laboratory. While they probably cannot be measured during the project period, other objectives of the project include: making water curriculum more practical oriented, making the instruction model more interactive and student centered, and making the learning environment more engaging. The Districts anticipate that the laboratory will improve classroom flexibility, affect positively on classroom practice, student motivation, and participation. Additionally, the laboratory may encourage more students to pursue careers in watershed stewardship. 

Methods
Livingston School Districts 4 and 1 are proposing to create a mobile water laboratory to conduct watershed study activities in the field or in close proximity to streams and rivers, namely Fleshman Creek and the Yellowstone River in Park County. The Districts will use the laboratory to facilitate curriculum-based hands-on learning activities in the areas of restoration, nonpoint source pollution, water-quality standards and monitoring, riparian management, weed control, and aquatic habitat.

Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The Naches River Basin Water Quality Restoration Project addresses a 303(d) stream temperature listing in the Naches River by implementing riparian vegetation recovery actions. This project will establish and improve 63 acres of floodplain and riparian vegetation and begin establishing 75-foot buffers along 4,652 feet of the Naches River main stem and its side channels.  It will also plan improvements across 114 additional acres and 9,652 feet of stream bank.

Objectives

			 The goal is to address the stream temperature 303(d) listing in the lower Naches River by increasing
			 shade availability alongside channels and floodways and to improve overall floodplain health by
			 implementing riparian vegetation restoration actions. Riparian buffer establishment with the
			 appropriate trees and shrubs will provide long-term shade, reduce solar radiation, improve hyporheic
			 exchange and groundwater surface water recharge, and establish a source of large wood recruitment.
			 Over the long-term, much of this area will convert to fully connected and functional floodplain and
			 side channels along the Naches River.
		  

Methods

			 All required landowner agreements, permitting documentation, cultural resource determinations,
			 riparian planting plans, and ECOLOGY forms.
			 * Approximately 2,500 native riparian trees and shrubs installed and established on seven floodplain
			 acres and along 1,600 feet of side channel.
			 * Treatment of noxious and invasive weed species across 37 total floodplain acres (including those

Several water bodies within the San Pitch River Watershed are currently not meeting their designated beneficial uses due to total dissolved solid concentrations. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) analysis has been submitted to the EPA and approved November 18, 2003.  In addition, the upper San Pitch River is designated as a 3A coldwater fishery, and has been identified by the Utah Division of Water Quality as having high concentrations of total phosphorus, requiring further evaluation. This Demonstration Project Implementation Plan (PIP) addresses the primary sources of dissolved solids and other pollutant sources which have been identified through TMDL development and 305b reporting.  With the support and direction of the Watershed Stewardship Group we will design and implement projects for several categories of non-point source pollution. These will include the development of irrigation water management, range management to reduce upland erosion of saline soils, well head protection, Twelve Mile sediment slides, riparian restoration, and pasture improvements. Because comprehensive nutrient management plans are a necessity in most areas of the San Pitch River funding for CNMP’s are easier to come by with other grant sources.  Our focus will lean more towards all other improvements in the San Pitch River Watershed.  By demonstrating all improvement practices to area producers and stakeholders we hope to encourage them to adopt and implement similar activities to address their own water quality problems as well as improving critical species habitat. In addition, a separate state-wide proposal outlines the goals and tasks for a watershed coordinator to assist the San Pitch River Watershed Stewardship Group in developing a watershed plan to address non-point source pollution for a variety of sources, which has been completed and distributed.

Objectives
Goal #1: Improve stability of the stream channel and enhance the riparian corridor to reduce sediment nutrient loading to the river and its tributaries.  Reduce approximately 7,000 kg/year in sediment from streambank erosion.

Goal #2: Improve pasture condition and implement management practices to protect well heads and help reduce runoff and sources of salinity as well as identify critical species habitat.  As complimentary management components to Goals 3 and 4, load reductions are cited below.

Goal #3: Improve upland management practices to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff to the river and its tributaries.  Upland erosion was identified in the TMDL as 14% of the total load of TDS to the San Pitch River.  Reducing this erosion by 20% will reduce loading by approximately 950 tons per year.

Goal #4:  Replace flood irrigation with efficient and effective irrigation practices to reduce water usage and runoff from saline soils.  Reducing flood irrigation return flows in the middle San Pitch River by 25% will result in reduction of approximately 3200 tons/year TDS.

Goal #5:  Inform and educate the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of maintaining and improving water quality within the watershed.

Methods
Goal #1: Improve stability of the stream channel and enhance the riparian corridor to reduce sediment, TDS and nutrient loading to the river and its tributaries.

Objective 1: Develop project to reduce sediment and nutrient loading to the river through improved function of the stream bank and riparian area.

Task 1 - Select and identify project cooperators, develop, and implement stream bank and riparian improvement plan using BMPs and bioengineering principles (such as willow revetment, grassed waterways, willow plantings, etc.).  Selection will be prioritized for areas where fishery habitat will benefit from stream bank restoration.  Currently, approximately 4 miles of stream bank have been identified for treatment.  Priority for additional treatment areas will be place on stream banks contiguous with those currently identified.

Output: One (1) stream bank restoration project - If NRCS is not available for project design, projects will be bid out to other engineering companies for design.

Goal #2: Improve pasture condition and implement management practices to protect well heads and help reduce runoff and sources of salinity as well as identify critical species habitat.

Objective 1: Reduce the contribution of non-point sources of TDS from erosion and runoff from pastures as well as protecting well head water sources.

Task 2 - Identify cooperator and implement a combination of reseeding and pasture management while protecting well heads, so that critical species habitat is maintained.  This will likely be a combination of grazing management and vegetation of meadows to increase retention of irrigation water, protecting well head areas, and reduce contribution of TDS from saline pasture lands.

Output: One (1) pasture reseeding/management project

Total Cost: $25,000      319: $15,000      Match: $10,000

Objective 1: Reduce non-point source TDS pollution, sediment and nutrients from improved upland management and /or reseeding.

Task 3 – Develop and implement upland management plan using BMPs. This will likely be a combination of shrub removal and reseeding and grazing management.  Several areas of eroding rangeland have bee identified though the TMDL study for which habitat improvements and control of sedimentation from strongly saline soils will likely reduce TDS loading from uplands.

Output: One (1) upland reseeding/management project

Total Cost: $25,000      319: $15,000      Match: $10,000

Goal #4: Improve irrigation techniques and management practices to reduce TDS and runoff to the river and its tributaries.

Objective 1: Reduce TDS loading in the lower San Pitch River from improved irrigation techniques and management.  This will likely entail conversion from flood irrigation to sprinkler systems.

Task 4 – Identify project cooperators, develop irrigation water management plan using BMPs and implement project.

Output: One (1) irrigation management project.  If NRCS is not available for project design, projects will be bid out to other engineering companies for design.

Total Cost: $100,000      319: $60,000      Match: $40,000

Goal #5:  Inform and educate the community concerning non-point source pollution and the importance of maintaining and improving water quality within the watershed.

Objective 1: Share general and technical information with producers and area stakeholders.

Task 5 – Conduct 3 tours to projects implemented through this project. The tours will be conducted either near project completion or shortly after. USU Extension, NRCS, District staff and the landowner will jointly plan this tour.

Task 6 – Develop Brochure/Fact Sheets, Newspaper Articles, and other Media Spots

Nutrient trading between the load allocation for nonpoint sources and waste load allocation for point source dischargers has been proposed as a means for saving money in the waste water treatment facilities.  Initial modeling by the Association of Central Oklahoma Governments (ACOG) of the North Canadian River in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area has shown that NPS pollution between Canton Reservoir and Lake Overholzer significantly affects the models for waste load allocations downstream for the Oklahoma city metropolitan area.  Nutrient trading between nonpoint source load allocations and waste load allocations could potentially result in less stringent discharge permits to the river and cost saving to the cities.  

Nutrient trading is largely an unexplored concept in Oklahoma.  The tasks of this proposal are designed to compliment the ACOG TMDL development with additional modeling to demonstrate the feasibility and cost versus benefits to accomplish nutrient trading to save in cost in waste water treatment.  This project will serve as a case study on nutrient trading.  The results of this project will be compiled into a nutrient trading strategy document.

In order to present a comprehensive work plan some of the tasks included are commitments under various 604(b) and 205(j) grants to ACOG.  The contributions from the ACOG grants and the proposed breakdown of costs for the FY 95 319 grant are result of a December 15, 1994 pilot meeting between the Oklahoma Conservation Commission, John Harrington of ACOG, Bob Lynch and Kelly Smith of the OSE, and Terry Mendiola and Troy Hill of EPA region VI.


Objectives
To model land uses within the North Canadian River basin to identify and quantify associated non point sources of nutrients, appropriate BMPs for controls and expected reductions in loading.  To review the cost and benefits of BMP implementation for nutrient reductions to the downstream municipal and industrial dischargers for nutrient allocation trading within the TMDL.

To compile a nutrient trading strategy document specific to Oklahoma. This document can be used to direct future nutrient trading efforts in Oklahoma.

Project applicability:  This project is ultimately expected to lead to BMP implementation within this priority watershed.  The down stream dischargers are expected to fund at least in part the cost of nutrient reductions from the savings to the treatment process.


Methods
Task 1.	Cooperative Agreement. The first task of this project is to formalize the commitments of ACOG and the OCC to accomplish the following tasks.  Some of the tasks will require modification and approval by EPA Region VI of output commitments for the ACOG 604(b) grants.

Task 2.	Project Advisory Group.  A project advisory group will be established for the purpose of reviewing the activities outlined in this work plan.  The advisory group will serve in establishing data quality objectives and will serve as the primary technical review authority within this project.  A secondary function of this group will be to maintain involvement of parties directly affected by the results of this project. Members will include:

John Harrington (ACOG)
Russel Dutnell (OCC)
John Hassell (OCC)
Bob Bedner (DEQ)
Sylvia Ritzky(OSE)
Troy Hill (EPA)
Representative (Oklahoma City)
Representative (Del City)
Representative (City of Yukon)
Representative (City of El Reno)
 
Representative Oklahoma County Conservation District Board of directors.

The Project Advisory Group will meet on a quarterly basis.


Task 3.	Quality Assurance Quality Control Project Plan, to be written for all data collection activities.  The Quality assurance plan for this TMDL project will be written by ACOG to satisfy the output requirement 500 of their FY90 205(j) grant as agreed in the project pilot meeting December 15, 1994.


Task 4.	Stream water quality reconnaissance will be conducted with a 2 - 3 day assessment of stream water quality and time of travel studies at six sites along the North Canadian River between upstream of El Reno and the town of Dale down stream of the metropolitan area.  The purpose of this brief study is to update the information available  at low flow conditions, and to identify problem areas at low flow that may significantly impact the water quality of the combined flow downstream of the metropolitan dischargers. Preliminary to this study, periphytometrers will be deployed to assess the relative productivity at the six sites.  After a 10 - 14 day interval the periphytometers will be collected as well as grab samples for water quality.  From each site water samples will be analyzed for Chlorophyll a, nutrients, BOD 20, suppressed BOD, BOD 5, Chloride, TSS, fecal coliform/strep, and alkalinity. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and conductivity will be measured in situ.  The diurnal dissolved oxygen profile will be assessed at three sites and time of travel will be assessed from two sites.  Funding for this task will be from FY90 205(j) grant  The field investigations for this exercise will be contracted to the OCC.

Task 5.	Intensive Dry Weather Study.  Water quality data will be gathered over a twenty-four hour period at ten sites from down stream of Lake Overholser to down stream of the Town of Jones.  From each site four water samples taken  over a twenty-four hour period will be flow weighted and composited.  Composite samples will be analyzed for Chlorophyll a, nutrients, BOD 20, suppressed BOD, BOD 5, Chloride, TSS, fecal coliform/strep, and alkalinity. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and conductivity will be measured in situ.  The diurnal dissolved oxygen profile will be assessed at three sites and time of travel will be assessed at all ten sites.  Light and dark bottle productivity/respiration will be assessed at two sites.  This task will be a joint effort and will be funded jointly by this FY95 319 grant and FY90 205(j) ACOG grant.

Task 6.	Loading Estimate of nutrients and sediments from the watershed will be contracted to Oklahoma State University by the OCC as part of this FY95 319 grant.  Using existing land use and water quality data, a watershed model will be constructed to quantify the major nonpoint source loads from the watershed.  
 
Task  7.	Model Calibration.   ACOG will use data generated by the dry weather study  and the nutrient loading estimates from OSU  to calibrate  either a QUAL2E or WASP.  This task will be funded as part of the  ACOG FY93 604(b) grant.

Task 8. 	Control Strategy.  Based on the calibrated model ACOG will propose to the DEQ and EPA both a waste load allocation and load allocation for a TMDL for the North Canadian River.  The allocations proposed will allow for modification through nutrient trading.  This task will be funded as part of the FY94 604(b) ACOG grant.

Task 9.	Nutrient Trading Strategy Document.  The process required to achieve nutrient trading between waste load allocations and load allocations in Oklahoma will be outlined in a Nutrient Trading Strategy Document.  Using the North Canadian River as a case study the strategy document will discuss the feasibility, costs and benefits of nutrient trading.  Potential BMPs will be identified and documentation for expected nutrient load reductions will be compiled.  A  financial model will be developed to predict the costs and benefits from BMP implementation in the watershed and to compare this with the costs of additional waste water treatment to meet TMDL requirements.

The Waconda Watershed is a large watershed covering 3,272,675 acres, or roughly 5,144 square miles.   Primarily an agricultural area, cropland comprises 49% of land cover within the watershed.  Grassland and pasture account for another 44% of the land use in the watershed, and the remaining 7% is accounted for through small urban areas (4%), surface water, wetlands, and woodlands.  The large economic reliance on agriculture and livestock within the watershed places a large ecologic burden on the Waconda Watershed's streams and rivers.  Issues such as overgrazing, allowing cattle access to streams, improper fertilizer application, and large feedlots degrade the water quality within the watershed.   

In 2006 and 2007, the Solomon Valley RC&D Area, Inc. used 319 monies to initiate a WRAPS Development Phase.  The primary accomplishments of this phase were: 
1.  Organization of a Stakeholder Leadership Team 
2.  Information and Education activities that helped introduce issues of water quality to the residents of the watershed 
3.  Compilation of water quality concerns of watershed residents 

With the completion of the development phase, the Solomon Valley RC&D Area, Inc. is now ready to assess the conditions of the watershed more closely in order to determine primary sources/causes of non-point source pollution.  The information gathered during assessment activities will be used to target areas most in need of best management practices and to plan for how to implement and fund these BMPs.


Objectives
The goal of this assessment and planning phase is to characterize watershed conditions, identify needs and opportunities, and understand how the watershed responds to various management scenarios.  The assessment activities will facilitate the preparation of a document that identifies actions necessary to achieve stakeholder-established watershed goals.

The Scott River is a tributary to the Klamath River, located in Siskiyou County California. The Scott River Watershed drains 812 square miles. Land ownership is 55% private and 45 % Federal land. Land-use in the Scott River is primarily agricultural, hay and grain, private timber, and wilderness. The Scott River Watershed is listed as impaired for Sediment and Temperature under the Section 303 (d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. In Dec. 2005 the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB) adopted the Action Plan for the Scott River Sediment and Temperature Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). In the Action Plan the NCRWQCB requested Siskiyou County “to study the connection between groundwater and surface water, the impacts of groundwater use on surface flow and beneficial uses, and the impacts of groundwater levels on the health of riparian vegetation in the Scott River Watershed.” This request has been addressed by the Scott River Groundwater Study Plan (GW Study Plan)developed by U.C. Davis. The Scott River has performed voluntary groundwater monitoring along and multiple other tasks developed in the GW Study Plan since 2006. The proposal will increase our understanding of the Scott River’s surface water, groundwater and stream morphology allowing for a synthesis of these important watershed processes to help direct future restoration and protection programs.
This project proposes to implement activities identified in the Scott River Action Plan to address temperature and sediment sources in the Scott River. This project will continue the implementation of the GW Study Plan and the assessment of the geomorphology of the Scott River and major tributaries. The proposed project will explore the links between surface water, groundwater, stream and bank morphology and riparian vegetation. The proposed investigations will refine the Scott River Groundwater Model and Water Balance and increase the extent of the geomorphic assessment, leading to a better understanding of the factors that will contribute to successful projects to vegetate and reduce sediment in the Scott River

Objectives
This project proposes to implement activities identified in the Scott River Action Plan to address temperature and sediment sources in the Scott River Watershed. Specifically this project will continue the implementation of the GW Study Plan. The GW Study Plan will evaluate cumulative effects of groundwater and surface water use on the Scott River systems flows and temperature, It will also identify opportunities and potential solutions for addressing Scott River temperature issues.

Methods
Task 1.Continue the Development of the Groundwater model of Scott Valley 
1a-Prepare initial model, to be completed by UC Davis December 2009 
1b Refine groundwater model through study element 5.1.9 Hydraulic groundwater tests: pumping tests and slug tests. 
• The Siskiyou RCD and local landowners met with Ryan Hines (U.C Davis Graduate Student) in October 2009 and identified four general regions of the aquifer for completion of pump tests. Several landowners have indicated willingness to participate in pump tests. The RCD will assist U.C. Davis in the completion of pump tests in the spring/summer of 2010. This data will be used to calibrate the Groundwater Model. 
• UC. Davis will provide the Scott Valley Groundwater Model to Siskiyou County . County and/or RCD employees will receive training in utilization of the model. 

Task 2. Expand voluntary groundwater level monitoring program. 
The GW Study plan recommends expanding the original 30 locations to a minimum of one well per sq/mile. To date the program has been expanded to 44+ wells. This project will continue to expand the program to try to reach the recommended density of one piezometer/test well per sq. mile, a total of approximately 150 observation wells. RCD staff will work with U.C Davis and/or the NRCS to determine if new well locations are appropriate. 

Task 3. Identify , construct, and monitor important additional stream gage locations. 
The Siskiyou RCD will continue the operation of three mainstem steamflow stations during summer low flow conditions. The Siskiyou RCD will contract with a qualified hydrologist to analyze surface flow data collected at these locations, as well as tributary locations throughout the watershed. The consultant will refine the prelimary Scott River Water Balance Model, and Scott River Runoff Forecast Model.(Deas 2004, 2005). Gauging stream discharge at locations throughout the watershed is important to identify the quantity and timing of groundwater movement. 

Task 4 Increase the extent of stream geomorphology mapping 
The Scott River TMDL,Appendix A recommends “an analysis of fluvial geomorphology … in parallel to the ground-water study to determine where geomorphic restoration will need to occur prior to horticultural restoration”. In addition, the Shasta and Scott River Coho Recovery Plan specifically addresses riparian restoration in the Scott River Watershed. A specific Task: is: 
Scott HM-2a Evaluate the geomorphology of the Scott River System. Identify areas of high width to depth ratios, with entrenched channels, or other compromised areas. Implement projects that improve stream geomorphology at specific locations in conjunction with system-wide channel improvement. This geomorphological assessment is key to identification of appropriate locations for riparian replanting. This assessment, combined with the results of the Groundwater model, will identify locations on the mainstem Scott River and tributaries most likely to respond to revegetation efforts. 
RCD staff will complete longitudinal profiles and stream channel cross sections of an additional 10 kilometers of mainstem Scott River. This information will supplement the initial geomorphic assessment the RCD will be completing in 2010. Data will be used to refine and update recommendations made in the Scott River Strategy and Schedule for Riparian Replanting.

The Klamath Tracking and Accounting Program (Klamath TAP) defines a consistent accounting system that links conservation projects to load reductions called for in both California's and Oregon's Klamath River TMDLs. The Klamath TAP goal is to increase the pace and reduce the cost of improving Klamath Basin water quality to support all beneficial uses, including recovery of native fish. This project will: 1) integrate conservation priorities from multiple federal, state and private conservation initiatives interested in the Klamath river basin, 2) tailor tools to the specific needs of the Klamath basin and expand their applicability to additional conservation practices, 3) demonstrate the use of draft protocol and expanded tools by selecting, implementing and quantifying the benefits from multiple conservation projects, and 4) launch the full program by engaging program participants through training and outreach, and formally establishing the management system defined in the draft protocol. 

Objectives
The expansion of Klamath TAP described here will address impairments to Klamath main stem and tributaries including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. Also, this project will fulfill a task identified in both California’s and Oregon’s Klamath River TMDLs: to develop and implement a basinwide water quality tracking and accounting program that would establish a framework to track water quality improvements, facilitate planning and coordinated TMDL implementation, and enable appropriate water quality offsets or trades.

Methods

2.0 STATEMENT OF NEED  2.1 The Cheyenne River Basin has the potential to be impacted by Coal Bed Methane development within the watershed as well as the pipeline system being proposed by Phillips Petroleum Co. The landowners have requested that an environmental inventory and assessment be completed on the basin to determine if they are being impacted by the millions of barrels of water being dumped on the surface throughout the watershed as well as the numerous potential impacts from piping less then acceptable quality water into a two pond holding system and then releasing it into the Cheyenne River. In data compiled by the Niobrara County Commissioners, 7,914,812 barrels of CBM water where discharged and reported by methane companies within the watershed. (Oil and Gas Commission Website- 2001) . This calculates out to over 53 million cubic feet of water. The Cheyenne River Watershed is made up of predominately Clarkelen-Draknab-Dwyer that is considered a highly erosive soil. NCD is concerned that the pipeline system will cause a marked increase in the following parameters: SAR, EC, sediment, turbidity, TSS and TDS within the system. Due to the increase in SAR and EC there is potential of not meeting and protecting the beneficial uses of irrigation, wetlands, riparian zones, Agriculture and aquatic life within the watershed. The landowners need information and education in order to determine if they can utilize the water for their normal practices. The Niobrara Conservation District has been collecting grab samples and completing chemical, physical and biological monitoring on the Cheyenne River and several of its tributaries since 1999 under the NCD Sampling and Analysis Plan. 2.2 The Cheyenne River (Waterbody ID #WYCR10120103)  is a Class II warm water fishery. It is located in the Northern Great Plains Eco-region within the Cheyenne River Basin. There are 41 stream miles within the county at a sinuosity of 1.23. The stream is intermittent but has become more constant over the last four years. This information was provide by landowner observations. The predominant bedrock geology along the stream corridor is Alluvium. This geology includes deposits underlying present flood plains and bordering terraces. Fine sand, silt and clay contain lenses of poorly sorted course sand and gravel. The surrounding area is the Lance Formation. This formation is sandstone interbedded with claystone containing thin beds of carbonaceous shale and coal. The predominant surrounding area is native pasture with seasonal grazing, a few irrigated fields and a corridor of several ages of Native Cottonwoods. Within the floodplain to the stream there are new growth cottonwoods and vigorous stands of sedges. There are gravel and point bars in the initial stages of re-vegetation with riparian and woody plants. (Cottonwood Study - Steward 2002) Results of the Niobrara Conservation District water quality samples taken over the three-year period had no exceedances in any numeric standards for any of the parameters. Biological information includes adequate macro invertebrate populations. Fish were observed, small fish (<2"") were abundant and medium fish (3-6"") were rare (NCD BURP Assessment 1999-2002). Fish shocking data completed in 1994 showed abundant species and quantities. (Game and Fish Department - Fish Shocking Data 1994) 2.3 Map depicting the watershed area, past, present and future sampling locations and permitted point sources - ATTACHEMENT A. 2.4 The watershed is approximately 3,000 feet in elevation, receives and annual precipitation of 10-14"" with 75% falling between April and September. Snowfall varies from 30-65"". The average annual temperature is 46ø, with an average daily temperature of 71 ø in July and 24ø in January. The average length of the growing season is 115 days. The ownership of the watershed is mostly private, with some federal and state. The predominant land uses are seasonal livestock (cattle, sheep and buffalo)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Brown County Water Quality Improvement Project will target the reduction of nutrient and sediment loads in tributaries and lakes.  During the next two years, project staff will install BMPs to reduce nutrient and sediment load from agricultural runoff, sedimentation to the lakes from shoreline erosion, and provide public education and information.  

Activities planned include installation of: Animal Waste Management System(s), Grazing Management, Upland Habitat Improvements, Crop Rotation/Residue Management, Critical Area Plantings, Alternate Watering Systems, Riparian Buffer Establishment/Restorations, Urban BMPs to reduce sedimentation, and an Information & Education program.


SUMMARY OF MAJOR GOALS:  The Brown County Water Quality Improvement Project will address nutrient and sediment loadings in the Elm Lake, Elm River, Maple River, Moccasin Creek, and Richmond Lake watersheds.  Reducing non-point source pollutants in the watersheds will:  improve the water quality for downstream drinking water users, improve habitat for upland and aquatic species, and improve the recreational uses of the water bodies located within the project area.  Improving vegetation and managing grazing along these water bodies will reduce shoreline erosion and provide buffers which will prevent nutrients and sediment from entering the lakes and streams.  In addition, improved vegetation will increase the aesthetic quality of the streams and enhance the fishery.

Reduction of sediment and phosphorus entering the system will be accomplished using Best Management Practices (BMPs), such as no-till/minimum till, grazing management, riparian buffer establishment/restorations and critical area plantings.  An Information and Education program will be developed to inform producers in the project area of the project needs, opportunities to participate, and accomplishments.





Objectives
Objective 1:  Reduce phosphorus loading from the watershed in the lake by 60 percent by targeting livestock operations to meet the TMDL established for Elm Lake.

Objective 2:  	Reduce nutrient and sediment loading from cropland and riparian areas by installing BMPs in the Watershed.

Objective 3:	Install urban runoff BMPs –We will use the Moccasin Creek assessment as a guide for BMP implementation to reduce sediment load into the creek.

Objective 4:	Reduce phosphorus loading in the Richmond Lakewatershed by 20 percent by installing BMPs in the watershed.

Objective 5: 	Educate the landowners, operators and local people of the value of implementing Best Management Practices.
Objective 6:  Evaluate and Report Project Progress.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Brown County Water Quality Improvement Project will target the reduction of nutrient and sediment loads in tributaries and lakes.  During the next two years, project staff will install BMPs to reduce nutrient and sediment load from agricultural runoff, sedimentation to the lakes from shoreline erosion, and provide public education and information.  

Activities planned include installation of: Animal Waste Management System(s), Grazing Management, Upland Habitat Improvements, Crop Rotation/Residue Management, Critical Area Plantings, Alternate Watering Systems, Riparian Buffer Establishment/Restorations, Urban BMPs to reduce sedimentation, and an Information & Education program.


SUMMARY OF MAJOR GOALS:  The Brown County Water Quality Improvement Project will address nutrient and sediment loadings in the Elm Lake, Elm River, Maple River, Moccasin Creek, and Richmond Lake watersheds.  Reducing non-point source pollutants in the watersheds will:  improve the water quality for downstream drinking water users, improve habitat for upland and aquatic species, and improve the recreational uses of the water bodies located within the project area.  Improving vegetation and managing grazing along these water bodies will reduce shoreline erosion and provide buffers which will prevent nutrients and sediment from entering the lakes and streams.  In addition, improved vegetation will increase the aesthetic quality of the streams and enhance the fishery.

Reduction of sediment and phosphorus entering the system will be accomplished using Best Management Practices (BMPs), such as no-till/minimum till, grazing management, riparian buffer establishment/restorations and critical area plantings.  An Information and Education program will be developed to inform producers in the project area of the project needs, opportunities to participate, and accomplishments.





Objectives
Objective 1:  Reduce phosphorus loading from the watershed in the lake by 60 percent by targeting livestock operations to meet the TMDL established for Elm Lake.

Objective 2:  	Reduce nutrient and sediment loading from cropland and riparian areas by installing BMPs in the Watershed.

Objective 3:	Install urban runoff BMPs –We will use the Moccasin Creek assessment as a guide for BMP implementation to reduce sediment load into the creek.

Objective 4:	Reduce phosphorus loading in the Richmond Lakewatershed by 20 percent by installing BMPs in the watershed.

Objective 5: 	Educate the landowners, operators and local people of the value of implementing Best Management Practices.

This is a KS-WRAPS Implementation Project Proposal.  Funding requested under this proposal will continue the “Kanopolis Lake WRAPS Implementation” project and implementing strategies to restore and protect this watershed.   

1) Description of watershed:

The Kanopolis Lake WRAPS watershed includes the Big Creek Watershed and the Middle Smoky Hill Watershed.  The Big Creek Watershed covers portions of Gove, Trego, Ellis and Russell counties.  The Middle Smoky Hill Watershed covers portions of Trego, Ellis, Russell, Lincoln, Ness, Rush, Barton, and Ellsworth counties.

The Big Creek Watershed covers 852 square miles which includes 321 stream miles and 28 acres of lakes. The Big Creek Watershed drains to the Big Creek and Big Creek North Fork and their tributaries. Other streams that flow into Big Creek are Walker, Mud, Big Creek North Fork, Chetolah, and Ogallah Creeks. Many minor streams and creeks only flow during seasonal rainfall events. Three groundwater aquifers lie beneath this watershed. They are the High Plains Aquifer, the Dakota Aquifer and the shallow Alluvial Aquifers of the streams and creeks throughout the Big Creek area. There are 134 public water supplies that draw their drinking water from the aquifers in addition to thousands of private wells (estimated number of private wells in the city of Hays is 2,500). Water from these wells is used for domestic use, lawn and garden, monitoring, irrigation, and livestock sources. Irrigation is the primary use of water from the High Plains Aquifer. Land use activities can have a significant impact on the types and quantity of nonpoint source pollutants in the watershed. The primary land uses in the watershed are grasslands (49%), crop production (47%), urban areas and woodlands (4%).


The Middle Smoky Hill Watershed covers covers 1,562 square miles which includes 654 stream miles and 3,786 acres of lakes. The Middle Smoky Hill Watershed is the drainage waterway for the Smoky Hill River and its tributaries beginning at the dam below Cedar Bluff Reservoir in Trego County and traveling eastward to the dam below Kanopolis Lake in Ellsworth County. The major tributary contained in this watershed is Timber Creek in the western edge of the watershed. Numerous tributaries flow into the Smoky Hill River as it travels through the Middle Smoky Hill Watershed. Big Creek empties into the Smoky Hill in Russell County. The waters of the Smoky Hill River feed into Kanopolis Reservoir, a lake covering 3,742 surface acres. Storage in Kanopolis Reservoir began in 1948 as a multi-purpose project allocated for domestic, industrial and livestock water supply, flood control, water quality and recreation purposes. A smaller lake, Fossil Lake, is located on Fossil Creek near Russell. It covers 44 acres and is important for swimming, boating, fishing and domestic and industrial water supply. Major groundwater aquifers that underlie the watershed are the Dakota Aquifer, the Alluvial Aquifers from the river, and small portions of the High Plains Aquifer. There are 821 known groundwater wells located in the watershed in addition to an estimated 2,500 wells within the City of Hays. Water from these wells is used for domestic use, monitoring, lawn, garden, and irrigation supplies.

Land use activities can have a significant impact on the types and quantity of nonpoint source pollutants in the watershed. The primary land uses in the watershed land area are grasslands (41%), crop production (53%), with urban areas and woodlands occuping the remaining 6% of the watershed.

2) Watershed issues of concern:

The Big Creek and the Middle Smoky Hill (BCMSH) watersheds have each been classified as a “Category I – Watershed in Need of Restoration” by the 1999 Unified Watershed Assessment, completed by KDHE and NRCS.  Big creek is ranked 56th out of 92 watersheds need of restoration statewide, and Middle Smoky Hill is ranked 51st. 

Big Creek: According to the Unified Watershed Assessment, in Big Creek watershed 82.5% of the total stream miles are impaired; approximately 67% of the waterways and 50% of the lakes sampled require TMDLs. Streams segments in this watershed are impaired by fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), chloride (Cl), sulfate (Sulf), ammonia (NH3), selenium (Se) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Lakes are impaired by eutrophication (E) and insufficient water flow. Big Creek Oxbow and Ellis City Lakes are both impaired by and have received a TMDL for eutrophication. Insufficient water flow into both Big Creek Oxbow and Ellis City Lakes is a problem of concern.

Middle Smoky Hill: According to the Unified Watershed Assessment, 15.4% of the total stream miles in the Middle Smoky Hill Watershed are impaired: approximately 20% of the waterways and 40% of the lakes sampled require TMDLs.  Stream segments in this watershed are impaired by fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), sulfate (Sulf), and chloride (Cl). Lakes are impaired by eutrophication (E), and sulfate (Sulf).  Fossil Lake has received a low priority TMDL. Kanopolis Lake has received a high priority TMDL for eutrophication. Prevention of excess nutrients from entering the lakes is key in prohibiting eutrophication at greater rates than normal.  The approved TMDL requires a 50.4% reduction in Chlorophyll a concentration. An 80.1 % reduction in total phosphorus load is required to meet the chlorophyll a goal. In-lake total phosphorus concentration will be reduced by 46.3 % and in-lake total nitrogen concentration will be reduced by 47.9%. 

3) Previous Projects:

4) Activities completed under development, assessment, and planning:

The development phase of the WRAPS project was funded by grants to Post Rock Rural Water District, which hired a project coordinator to staff a watershed task force and to conduct educational activities in the watershed. The assessment phase was funded by grants to KCARE (Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and Environment) at Kansas State Research & Extension, which developed a watershed model and established base line water quality conditions. KCARE provided technical assistance and facilitation services. Midway through the WRAPS process, a KCARE Watershed Specialist joined the team to assist with planning and implementation phases of the project. The BCMSH watershed WRAPS was completed and submitted to KDHE in 2005. The current “Kanopolis Lake WRAPS Implementation” project is a continuation of implementing BMPs in this watershed, and stakeholders have made specific recommendations consistent with the action plan. Through these programs, local stakeholders in the BCMSH watersheds have identified specific goals and actions needed in order to achieve water quality improvement.  

5) Watershed Stakeholder Leadership Team information  
Answers to KDHE Questionnaire for Implementation Project Proposal are as follows:    

*Describe the role and operations of the Watershed Stakeholder Leadership Team (Question sixteen):

Members of the BCMSH WRAPS Leadership Team were selected with input from the Core Group (that have worked in the watershed on the driving tours, town hall meetings, and other activities) and with input from KDHE.  Core WRAPS team as of July 2005 wanted to be sure that one producer from each county was included as part of the team along with 1 NRCS DC, 1 county Agent, 1 District Manager, and then members from other groups. There are currently sixteen members on the Leadership Team.  The Leadership team has a goal of meeting at least two times per year. Decisions are made by a consensus of the group along with input from the Core Group (representatives from all counties within the watersheds from NRCS, CD, County Extension Agents, and Stacie Minson, Watershed Specialist).  KSU has custody of the records and Minson along with the core Group have access to most records.  Individual stakeholders access these records via phone call, mail, and/or email.  Leadership team decisions are reported to the larger watershed community via public meetings, news releases, conservation district meetings/annual meetings, county extension staff, and conservation district newsletters, and radio.

*How does the Watershed Leadership Team evaluate its effectiveness and performance. (Question Seventeen): 

The BCMSH WRAPS Leadership Team evaluates its effectiveness and performance by looking at water quality improvements, BMPs implemented, and number of acres, etc in the watershed actively participating in programs and attending field days and tours.  Evaluations are given at meetings, tours, etc to serve as a check and balance.


*What steps does the Watershed Leadership Team take to assure that all watershed stakeholders see the relevance of the WRAPS project and how the project and Leadership Team serves the interests of all stakeholders. (Question eighteen): 

To assure that all watershed stakeholders see the relevance of the WRAPS project, the team continues to promote events and activities and members continue to make one-on-one contacts with producers, landlords, etc.  The core group (NRCS, CD, County Extension Agents, and Watershed Specialist) works with producers, landlords, and urban citizens on a daily basis.  Team members have agreed to actively participate in sampling and demonstrations to set an example and encourage other producers to do the same.

The City of Hays is the largest city within the watersheds and is required to have an NPDES Phase II Permit for Stormwater Management and Education.  We will be working with the City of Hays to determine what, if any, pollutant loading is directly associated with the City of Hays through the Big Creek Monitoring Project.

Big Creek Monitoring Project 

The Big Creek Middle Smoky Hill River (BCMSHR) Watershed Leadership Team requests that a water sampling project be implemented. In looking at ways to implement water quality management, several groups have come forth to participate. These include the Department of Agriculture, Department of Biological Sciences, and Department of Geosciences at Fort Hays State University (FHSU), the City of Hays, Kansas State University (KSU) Research and Extension, and the BCMSHR WRAPS group.  For this project, we will focus on water quality encompassing rural and urban components of the Big Creek and Smoky Hill River watersheds in Ellis County, Kansas. We will have several monitoring sites on this project including: 
  
1.	Culverts located at 41st street at Rolling Hills Disc Golf Course
2.	Skyline draw along Skyline drive at west edge of Daniel G. Rupp Memorial Park
3.	Lincoln draw bridge before it goes underground at W. 20th street and Lincoln Draw
4.	Lincoln draw under the railroad tracks at E. 9th street after it comes aboveground just south of APAC
5.	Big Creek bridge on Highway 183 south of Hays
6.	Big Creek bridge on Bison road downstream of the Hays Sewage Treatment effluent
7.	Big Creek bridge on Commerce parkway before the town of Munjor (south bridge)
8.	Smoky Hill River bridge on Highway 183 east of Schoenchen

Each partner’s contribution is unique and vital for the overall success of the project.  The City of Hays is interested in this information to better plan and manage stormwater while developing and incorporating water quality management practices into the City of Hays expansion.  Fort Hays State University’s Departments of Agriculture, Biological Sciences, and Geosciences recognize the importance of this project as being vital to assist students in preparing for real life scenarios while incorporating the experience into the classroom.  FHSU students involved in the project will be responsible for water sampling and presenting results to the BCMSHR WRAPS Leadership Team. Ultimately, with FHSU students taking active roles in water quality sampling they will carry into their careers and lives the importance of water quality across the State of Kansas and/or the United States.  

The BCMSHR WRAPS group’s goal is to insure that the process is being conducted appropriately to improve and/or protect the water resources in the watershed.  Kansas State University’s role is vested as being a land grant university by taking research and education to the residents of Kansas. KSU will be responsible for grab sample analysis and Isco sampler maintenance along with providing results back to the BCMSHR WRAPS Leadership Team regularly. 
  
Sampling procedures will consist of Isco samplers, Manta (multi- parameter probe) and grab samples across the sites.  We will have three Isco samplers that will be located in the Lincoln Draw Watershed in the City of Hays at critical locations.  Lincoln Draw is the critical component for the City’s stormwater management plan and could serve as the pollution prevention measure with the best management practice implementations. The other six sites will be placed at several strategic locations within Ellis County (Figure 1) including two within the city limits of Hays (Figure 2) and four outside the city limits of Hays that could indicate pollutant sources. 

Currently, we do not have monitoring data to quantify the pollutant load for this portion of the watershed.   Our goal will be to estimate Big Creek’s share of the Kanopolis Lake phosphorous and nitrogen load impacting the TMDLs.  We will also monitor Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels as part of the project because TMDL listings for bacteria were withheld within the watersheds due to Kansas legislation changes.  This project addition is due to high E. coli levels at Munjor, Kansas taken at the KDHE sampling location during the summer 2006.  

Sampling frequency will consist of eight monitoring locations (listed above) sampled biweekly and after storm events that produce water run- off.  For example, we have two to four sites that should contain flowing water at any given time of the year yielding thirteen months of data at those locations.  The other four or six sites will most likely only have water after storm events.  These data will be sporadic but important, so sites will be consistently monitored and status documented.  

Sample analysis will consist of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, E. coli, total suspended solids, temperature, pH, salinity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, percent dissolved oxygen saturation, flow rate, stream depth, and site observations. 

In addition, grab samples will also be analyzed for the presence of Gram negative bacteria that carry genes for extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Genes that encode ESBLs confer resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics and their derivatives. They are a major concern to human health.  Preliminary results indicate the presence of such organisms in these samples. 

The Fort Hays State University Department of Geosciences will provide geospatial technology to support the project in three ways.  First, decimeter-accuracy GPS measurements of sampling locations will be collected, which will ensure precise placement of the locations in relation to nearby natural and artificial features. Second, to provide context for the sampling locations, 360 degree panoramic photographic composites will be taken and processed to generate user-controllable Quicktime Virtual Reality (QTVR) 3- D visualizations.  Third, the Department will generate cartographic products based on the latest available feature location and high- resolution aerial and satellite imagery in order to display the sampling locations at a variety of scales as well as visualize the sample data within the given watershed. 

This monitoring data will allow us to target specific areas of concern in the watershed.  Comparison of pollutant levels will take place across the sites.

****We had originally planned to subcontract $24,265 to Fort Hays State University for the Big Creek Monitoring project.
Instead, we will do the work interally, using three part-time technicians to do the monitoring wor

This is a WRAPS Implementation Project proposal for Kanopolis Reservoir / Big Creek and Middle Smoky Hill River (BCMSHR), HUC 10260006, 10260007.    The Middle Smoky Hill River and Big Creek Watershed Restoration And Protection Strategy Report was submitted to and approved by KDHE in July 2005. The Leadership Team has been working diligently since then to improve and/or protect water resources in the watersheds. 

The BCMSHR Goals in the WRAPS document include: 
Reduce cropland and streambank erosion; 
Reduce erosion from land in CRP and maintain acres enrolled in CRP; 
Reduce fecal coliform bacteria originating from livestock; 
Manage grazing lands to reduce erosion; 
Reduce pollutants from urban areas; 
Develop a nutrient management plan; 
Reduce or eliminate illegal dumping of sewage and trash; Provide storm water management for urban and transportation activities; and 
Manage oil wells and oils fields concerning saltwater disposal, plugging abandoned wells, cleanliness at drilling sites, and sludge spread on leased roads. 

WATERSHED DESCRIPTION AND CONCERNS:

The Big Creek Watershed covers 852 square miles which includes 321 stream miles and 28 acres of lakes. The Big Creek Watershed drains to the Big Creek and Big Creek North Fork and their tributaries. The Middle Smoky Hill Watershed covers 1,562 square miles which includes 654 stream miles and 3,786 acres of lakes. The Middle Smoky Hill Watershed is the drainage waterway for the Smoky Hill River and its tributaries beginning at the dam below Cedar Bluff Reservoir in Trego County and traveling eastward to the dam below Kanopolis Reservoir in Ellsworth County. 

The primary threats to water quality in the BCMSHR Watersheds are sedimentation, nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria. 

According to the 1999 Unified Watershed Assessment, in the Big Creek Watershed, 82.5% of the total stream miles are impaired. Approximately, 67% of the waterways and 50% of the lakes require TMDLs for Fecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB), Chloride (CL), Sulfate (SLF), Ammonia (AM), Selenium (SE), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO). Lakes are impaired by Eutrophication (E) and insufficient water flow. Approximately 55% of the streams are impaired by FCB, 17% by SLF, 17% by CL, and 11% by nitrates. 

According to the 1999 Unified Watershed Assessment, in the Middle Smoky Hill River Watershed, 15.4% of the total stream miles are impaired. Approximately 20% of the waterways and 40% of the lakes sampled require TMDLs for Fecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB), Chloride (CL), and Sulfate (SLF). Lakes are impaired by Eutrophication (E) and Sulfate (SLF). Approximately 48% of the streams are impaired by FCB, 26% by SLF, and 26% by CL. 

Kanopolis Lake is listed on the states 303d –Impaired Waters – list due to Eutrophication, chloride, and sulfate. Fossil Lake has received a low priority TMDL and Kanopolis Lake has received a high priority TMDL for Eutrophication. Fossil Lake and Kanopolis Lake have TMDLs for siltation and reductions are needed. 

Kanopolis Reservoir, designed as a multi-purpose use project on the Smoky Hill River, is federally authorized for flood control, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife, water quality, downstream low flow augmentation, navigation, hydroelectric power, and water supply. The irrigation purpose cannot be implemented until an irrigation district has been constituted to use the water. Navigation and hydroelectric power are no longer eligible operating purposes. The State of Kansas designated uses include: general purpose; expected aquatic life; primary contact recreation; domestic water supply; food procurement; and irrigation water supply. 

In 1946, during construction, the original multi-purpose pool and flood pool storage capacities of Kanopolis Reservoir were 447,251 acre-feet. The designed sedimentation rate was 564 acre-feet/year. The most current sedimentation survey was done in 1993 with an estimated actual sedimentation rate at 643 acre-feet/year. From the designed sedimentation rate to the most current actual sedimentation rate, we have a 13% additional sediment load impacting Kanopolis Reservoir. 

The estimated current capacity is at 409,383 acre-feet or 9.15% loss of capacity due to sedimentation. With one of Kanopolis Reservoir’s state designated uses being for domestic water supply, the Post Rock Rural Water District supplies water for eleven wholesale accounts of seven cities and four rural water districts. This equates to a maximum quantity of 400 million gallons per year (mgy) for the district and 4,301.2 mgy for all of Kanopolis Reservoir water yields. However, applications for requests of water rights to the reservoir continue with six active applications at this date. If these applications are accepted the maximum quantity yield will be exceeded by 4,300 mgy (nearly double that of current rates). This will have a profound effect on the more than one-half million visitors that utilize Kanopolis Reservoir and surrounding area for a variety of outdoor recreational activities.  The need to address the primary threats of sedimentation, nutrients (Eutrophication)and fecal coliform bacteria is critical for water quality restoration and protection.  

In May of 2006, Kanopolis Lake was 4 feet below conservation pool compared to May of 2007 when Kanopolis Lake was 17 feet above. On August 22, 2006, Kanopolis Lake was 6.5 feet below conservation pool compared to August 22, 2007 at 4 ½"" above conservation pool. In the spring of 2007, when the USACE placed beach lines and buoys in the lake, prior to the May rainfall events, the water clarity was well above average. As storm events have taken place, the sediment and erosion loading is very apparent based on the degraded clarity and the dirty color of the lake. A very definite change took place in a matter of hours following the events of early May indicating severe erosion occurring upstream. If the sediment is getting to the lake, then we also know that nutrients and bacteria are also being deposited into the lake at a higher than average rate.

Summary of Activities: 

The development phase of the WRAPS project was funded by grants to Post Rock Rural Water District, which hired a project coordinator to staff a watershed task force and to conduct educational activities in the watershed. The assessment phase was funded by grants to KCARE (Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and Environment) at Kansas State Research & Extension, which developed a watershed model and established base line water quality conditions. KCARE provided technical assistance and facilitation services. Midway through the WRAPS process, a KCARE Watershed Specialist joined the team to assist with planning and implementation phases of the project. The BCMSH watershed WRAPS was completed and submitted to KDHE in 2005. The current project is a continuation of implementing BMPs in this watershed. Stakeholders have made specific recommendations consistent with the action plan. Through these programs, local stakeholders in the BCMSH watersheds have identified and will implement specific goals and actions needed to achieve water quality improvement. 



Objectives
GOAL
The BCMSHR WRAPS Team's goal is to restore and protect the waters in the Big Creek Middle Smoky Hill River Watersheds and Kanopolis Reservoir. 

Specific water quality goals for the WRAPS include: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) greater than 5 mg/L, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) less than 3.5 mg/L, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) less than 808mg/L, and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) less than101 mg/L, and Fecal Coliform Bacteria less than 200cfu/100ml for swimming, and less than 2,000cfu/100ml for boating and fishing in rivers and lakes. 


We hope to achieve these water quality goals through education, awareness, and implementation of best management practices aimed at these specific goals: 

1. Reduce Sedimentation in the BCMSHR Watersheds to reach TMDL Goals 
2. Reduce Nutrients and Eutrophication in the BCMSHR Watersheds to reach TMDL Goals 
3. Reduce Fecal Coliform Bacteria in the BCMSHR Watersheds to reach TMDL Goals 
4. Reduce Pollutants from Urban and Rural Areas in the BCMSHR Watershed to reach TMDL Goals 


The following goals and sub-goals in the BCMSHR WRAPS action plan are being addressed through BCMSHR stakeholder activities, this grant, and other current and future funding sources.  It should be noted that not all of these goals or sub-goals will be met in this project.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Stacie Minson, Watershed Specialist (funded under another PIP), is central to implementing the BCMSHR WRAPS action plan and will continue to organize Leadership Team meetings and inform stakeholders of WRAPS activities and events and encourage broad-based participation. Minson will work with collaborating partners to report data and implement action items on a watershed basis. Minson will work in the watersheds with agriculture producers and landowners, citizens, businesses, city and county governments, city, county, and state agencies, local organizations and groups to inform of WRAPS activities and to encourage behavior change and BMP implementation. 

The resources central to implementing BCMSHR WRAPS are funded under another KDHE PIP for KSU “Technical Assistance Services”: Stacie Minson (Watershed Specialist), James Leiker & Phil Barnes (Technical Assistance, Monitoring, and Analysis).  

INFORMATION AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES:
Continue WRAPS Information and Education activities within the limits of existing resources and through the network of WRAPS collaborators for the watershed (fact sheets, brochures, poster, displays, website posted material & powerpoint presentations) 

Additional media and promotional efforts will be encouraged but available on a limited basis due to lack of funding (e.g. radio promotion, newspaper special additions, commercials, special publications, and articles.) 


EARTH:
Continue to cooperate with EARTH for an environmental education program in the school systems.  EARTH currently serves 6 school districts, 650 middle-school students, and 8 teachers.

WATERLINK:
Continue to cooperate with WATERLINK & Fort Hays State University.  WaterLINK is a service-learning project available to college and university faculty and community watersheds in Kansas.

NO-TILL WINTER CONFERENCE: 
Work with Conservation District Boards, DCs, and County Agents to solicit Ag producers to attend the No-Till Winter Conference in Salina.  Cooperate with No-Till on the Plains to send 6 producers to the conference.  The conference will provide producers with information on the benefits of no-till, increasing crop residue, and reducing cropland erosion, and how it applies to water quality and water quality protection. 

TERRACE REBUILD INCENTIVE PROGRAM:
Cooperate with Ellsworth County Conservation District Sharing for a Watershed Wide Structural Practice & Management Decision Demo Project highlighting the concept of putting in structural practices and changing land management beliefs and practices.  Testimonials given by producers who participated in the demos as to how the systems are working better and then looking at monitoring data to indicate that the system is preventing sediment from leaving the fields.  This terrace rebuild project is funded through the Ellsworth County Conservation District (not under this grant).  To address the sedimentation and nutrient loading within the watersheds, especially because of the higher than average rainfall events for 2007 and as evident in the turbidity of Kanopolis Reservoir this summer, the WRAPS Leadership Team proposed a demonstration project to show that targeting the refurbishment of existing (failing) structural practices based on a watershed basis/HUC codes can reduce the sediment and nutrient loading.  In partnership with the watershed monitoring/sampling/analysis project, the project will utilize the results and NRCS computer programs to rank the best placement of terrace rebuilds instead of the historical, first come, first serve cost-share basis.  The benefit of this program will also be realized in some counties that don't offer the option of terrace rebuilds to producers as those counties have decided to focus county cost-share dollars on new terraces only.  

STREAMBANK STABILIZATION:
We will be working with the Ellsworth County Conservation District on 3 or 4 streambank stabilization projects in Ellsworth County for sediment and nutrient reduction depending upon whether or not landowners were approved and accepted for EQIP funds.  SCC will pay for technical assistance through the Watershed Institute.  Ellsworth County Conservation District will administer the funds.  These funds will be added to the EQIP contract awarded to the producer bringing the total cost-share funds to 90% and the producer's share to 10%. 

TECHNICAL ASSITANCE:
James Leiker, Phil Barnes, & Stacie Minson will provide technical assistance on the Watershed Monitoring/Sampling/Analysis project which would include sampling, analysis, interpretation of results, and recommendations for future BMPs to reduce pollutant loads.  On the Watershed Monitoring/Sampling/Analysis project, James Leiker is responsible for sampling, reporting, presentations, website management, and overall watershed work where needed.  On the Watershed Monitoring/Sampling/Analysis project, Phil Barnes, KSU Bio & Ag Engineering, is responsible for responsible for working on an overall watershed basis with interpretation of water monitoring results and recommendations for BMPs.

RNAS:  
Continue working with Carol Blocksome on rangeland issues through the Rangeland and Natural Areas Services (RNAS). Specific activities include: winter feeding site demonstration, conservation practices tour, two rangeland tours,  and four meetings (CRP management, oil production on rangelands, grassland management, burn workshop).

WATER FESTIVALS AND AG DAYS:
Continue with the Community Water Festivals & Kids Ag Days within the watershed to reach the urban audience on the need for reducing pollutants from entering water sources in the watersheds. This will be accomplished through the EARTH Grant.

Sediment Loading the Big Creek Middle Smoky Hill River Watersheds (BCMSHR) is one of the major TMDL and pollutant loading concerns within the watersheds.  Intense rainfall events in 2007 caused flooding events in the watersheds.  The damage of the flooding events caused county road erosion and many existing terraces to fail which increased sediment and nutrient loading downstream into Kanopolis Reservior.  

In discussions with the District Conservationists in the watersheds, we've determined there are three major types of flooding problems that contribute to sediment load in streams in the BCMSHR watersheds.  Calculations below are based on knowledge of the watershed as per District Conservationists and field office staff.   
1.  Scour erosion on bottomland fields where streams get out of the banks and cross an adjacent cropland field. Extent is maybe 1,000 acres, 10 tons/acre.  Average of once per year/per county/average precipitation.  So, we would be looking at 4 counties (Trego, Ellis, Russell, and Ellsworth) X 1,000 acres X 10 tons/acre = 40,000 tons of sediment/event. In 2007, we estimated 5 events across the watersheds = 200,000 tons/total for sediment loading.

2.  Gully erosion in cropland fields where level terraces overflow at their ends, and in draws that carry runoff. These areas need grassed waterways installed. Extent is maybe 1,500 acres. 20 tons per acre. Average of once per year/per county/average precipitation.  So, we would be looking at 4 counties x 1,500 acres X 20 tons/acre = 120,000 tons of sediment/event. In 2007, we estimated 5 events across the watersheds = 600,000 tons/total for sediment loading.

3.  County road erosion (caused by flooding) on the road surface and in the ditches is a major contributor of silt in our waterways. Many of our roads have no protective surface, and many are low maintenance, so erosion easily starts and gullies quickly develop. This type of erosion is very extensive and nearly totally ignored except for seeding the ditches of rebuilt roadbeds. The county has abandoned many county roads in the past 5 years that are quickly turning into uncontrolled gullies. Extent (use your number of square miles in the watershed) per square mile is about an average of 7 acres X 50% with erosion problems X 85% of area having roads or abandoned roads 10 tons per acre. Average of once per year/per county/average precipitation.  So, we would have approx. 2,400 sq. miles X 7 acres X 50% with erosion problems x 85% of area having roads abandoned or abandoned roads x 10 tons/acre = 71,400 tons of sediment/event.  In 2007, we estimated 5 events across the watersheds = 357,000 tons/total for sediment loading.

As we’ve moved into 2008, rainfall events have continued to occur so we would anticipate the same values for loading as we did in 2007.  

As a watershed, we will address the gully erosion in cropland fields to reduce sediment loading.  


Objectives
To reduce sedimentation in the watershed by implementing a Terrace Rebuild Incentive Program.

To address the sedimentation and nutrient loading within the watersheds, especially because of the higher than average rainfall events for 2007 and as evident in the turbidity of Kanopolis Reservoir this summer, the WRAPS Leadership Team is proposing a demonstration project to show that targeting the refurbishment of existing (failing) structural practices based on a watershed basis/HUC codes can reduce the sediment and nutrient loading.  In partnership with the watershed monitoring/sampling/analysis project, we will utilize the results and NRCS computer programs to rank the best placement of terrace rebuilds instead of the historical, first come, first serve cost-share basis or not funded at all because of putting limited resources into new practices.

By looking at our sampling data and computer generated watershed rankings, we will be able to look at what locations to place BMPs within the watershed that would have the greatest impact on reduction loads to address one of the three land resource management problems we address later in the application which is excessive cropland erosion due to old or recently flood damaged and failing terrace systems.  There are thousands of miles of terraces that were installed mainly in the 1940 through 1970 period, and many are of insufficient height and narrow based and some in fact are breeched and contributing to soil erosion and sedimentation.  The BMP to be addressed will be terrace rebuilds/refurbishments (only those that meet general NRCS criteria will be considered in the ranking process).  The Leadership team estimates 1,053,390 tons of sediment loading per year in the watersheds under normal rainfall conditions.  As of July 31, 2007, we are close to reaching the annual precipitation of 22-28 inches across the watersheds and exceeding it in some locations (WaKeeney – 19.17, Ellis 22.33, Hays 24.70, Russell 19.0, Kanopolis 28.77, and Ellsworth 31.82).  The team understands that this may be unusual conditions but recognize in dry years, the heavy, intense rainfall events still create excessive tons of sediment leaving fields.

The desire and importance of taking existing structural practices that are proven effective in sediment and nutrient control and bringing them back to current and modern water quality protection working standards is vital to TMDL reductions.  The terrace systems in the watersheds are not obsolete; they have just outlived their expected useful and beneficial life.  The team feels that by placing emphasis on this as a demonstration project, we will be able to reach many of the absentee and aging landowners that control a large portion of the cropland acres in the watersheds.  With that in mind, many of the tenants on those cropland acres see the need to improve farming conditions while being environmentally friendly and would be gladly accept the part of the project that would require a change in management practices on those acres.  The team would require a management plan be in place in regards to how those cropland acres would be treated after the terraces have been rebuilt.  For example, a landowner and tenant may be required to examine their nutrient management practices, residue management practices, etc.  

The team feels that the answer is not in the structural practice itself or in the conversion to no-till but in the entire system as a whole which includes properly functioning structural practices and overall management decisions being addressed and adopted.  By emphasizing this demonstration project as a BMP Structural and Management System, the landowner, tenants, and watersheds all reap the benefits of improved water quality.  


Methods
KSU Watershed Specialist, Stacie Minson, will work with the watershed team of Conservation District Managers, NPS Coordinators, and Buffer Coordinaters and NRCS DCs in Trego, Ellis, Russell, and Ellsworth County to develop the Terrace Rebuild Incentive Project.  This project will be pursued in conjunction with the WRAPS implementation project: 2007-0029: KS WRAPS: Kanopolis Reservoir, Big Creek and Middle Smoky Hill River Watersheds.  

The team will determine how to best spend the $25,000 incentive funds to get the most reduction load by using water monitoring data and distance to a water source.

The application period will be from May 15, 2008 to July 1, 2008 with producers being notified if they've received funding by August 1, 2008.

"333","items",NA,"KS",48120,"CWN: Kanopolis Rain Barrel Project","$14,000","Overview
The average homeowner is mostly unaware that their daily habits affect water quality.  In most people's minds, they pay a monthly utility bill to insure a clean, safe water supply while also paying the bill to take care of their waste water.  The problem lies with all of the water used outside their homes to water their lawns, gardens, and landscapes, wash cars, wash down driveways, wash down pet pens, etc.  All of these non-point pollution sources are creating water quality issues in the west end of the watersheds that drain into Kanopolis Reservoir at the east end of the watersheds which serves as a public drinking water supply and a major recreational destination.  

Stream water monitoring data since 2006 within and downstream of the City of Hays indicates a significant need to improve storm water water quality within the City of Hays.  Total Maximum Daily Load goals (as set by KDHE) for total nitrogen and phosphorous, total suspended solids, and E. coli are all well above goal limits.  To reduce Hays’s impact on the water quality in the Big Creek Watershed that drains into Kanopolis Reservoir (Big Creek near Munjor (downstream of Hays) is currently listed on the 303d list for E. coli, nitrogen, phosphorus, total suspended solids) actions need to be taken now to mitigate future water quality concerns of the Reservoir and the people who use it for public water supply and entertainment.  

In addition, monitoring data suggests that total nitrogen and phosphorus, total suspended solids, and E. coli are at higher than suggested TMDL levels across the watersheds as a whole, so implementing a WRAPS Watershed Rain Barrel Project Network will address these pollutants across the 2,400 square mile watersheds. 


Objectives
The WRAPS Watershed Rain Barrel Project Network will accomplish the following:  1)reduce TMDL loads (nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, and bacteria) within the watersheds based upon 2.5 years of continuous water monitoring, 2)educate and implement objectives in the WRAPS plan, 3)protect public water supplies that feed Kanopolis Reservoir, 4)demonstrate an innovative, cost-effective, low impact development of storm water management; 5)educate and engage watershed residents to alter everyday living habits for long-term water conservation and water resources protection; and 6)show homeowner ownership in protecting and/or improving water quality.  

Methods
The Ellsworth County Conservation District will serve as the sponsoring agency of the WRAPS Watershed Rain Barrel Project Network as previous projects that the WRAPS team and Watershed County Conservation Districts have worked on have been successful and built strong relationships across the watersheds.

The WRAPS project has partnered with Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., out of Victoria, Kansas for a supply of clean, 55 gallon barrels.  Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. feels this is a valuable partnership to protect the environment.

In this Watershed Wide Rain Barrel Project, we will ask homeowners to pay a minimal registration fee of approximately $10.00 which will cover 1/2 of the cost of the rain barrel.  This will encourage the homeowners to take a vested interest in the project as they will have ownership in the project. 

Fort Hays State University Agriculture Department students through service learning will help local residents build the rain barrels and share educational water quality information with those residents during the time spent helping the residents build the barrels.  Students are given the opportunity in this scenario to be the teachers and share how important it is to capture storm water and use it to water landscape plants instead of the water running off their property and carrying nutrients down the storm drains and into local water supplies.  FHSU students will learn about water quality non-point source pollution issues in the watersheds with presentations given by Minson and Leiker during class hours. Dr. Gleischner and Dr. Stephenson then follow-up in class with additional information and prepare students to answer questions during the building of the barrels. 

A fact sheet describing the relationship to storm water runoff management, water conservation, and water quality protection will be designed, printed and distributed to all Rain Barrel Project Participants.  

Each participant will also be provided with a handout explaining how to set the barrel up at home and how to prevent bacteria and algae from growing in the barrel.  

Local county newspapers in the watersheds, local community television stations, and local radio stations will help promote the event and then provide coverage at and following the events.

Teams consisting of but not limited to:  Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., Conservation District Staff and board members; NRCS field staff; WRAPS volunteers; Scouts; 4-H members; County Extension Agents; and FHSU Students & Faculty will participate in the events.  Events will be held in WaKeeney, Ellis, Hays, Victoria, Russell, Wilson, Dorrance, Ellsworth, and Kanopolis.  We anticipate a need for 1,150 barrels and this project would fund 1,000 of the barrels so additional grant sources will be sought in the future to continue with the project and get the project fully implemented and possibly repeated in communities that show an interest for a second event. 

A pilot event was held in Hays, Kansas on April 14, 2009 to determine if there was enough demand and interest in the watersheds before we requested funds for a WRAPS Watershed Rain Barrel Project Network.  We built and distributed 110 rain barrels. You can go to You Tube and type in Roll out the Rain Barrel to see the news coverage of the event. 

A survey was created via Survey Monkey to get feedback on the project and those participants that didn’t have internet access received the survey via postal service.  A total of 50 surveys were returned with overwhelming support for another event to be held. Here are some comments from survey results from the pilot event.  

•	Yes, conservation of water and chemical fee organic way to water. 
•	My plants do much better with rainwater than City water. I expanded my storage to 110 barrels of water and could easily handle doubling the storage capacity and the savings is great.  
•	Always collected rain water but just in plastic containers.
•	The handout was interesting; my main goal was conservation.
•	We were totally amazed at how much water comes off of the roof of a house during even a small rain. They told us but it is so much more impressive to actually see the barrel get half full with less than an inch of rain in the gauge.
•	It is a great way to ration and capture water.
•	I was very surprised how little rain we could get and it would fill your barrel. Great idea.
•	That it is important and possible to use alternative watering techniques.
•	I learned that in my situation it takes 1/3rd of an inch of rain to fill the barrel and I use it to maintain the water level in the pond I have in my back yard and various other watering projects in my landscape. The collection of rain water allows me to put the water where I need it when I need it rather than out the downspout and onto the lawn.
•	I had never heard of Rain Barrel use before this event.
•	Yes, everyone contributes to water quality issues.
•	I learned that it's pretty simple to collect rain water. Plus it helps a little on amount of water we use.
•	Didn't realize that storm water leaving my property affects local water supplies.
•	Would love to get another!
•	Please continue the program. 
•	Good Job!
•	I wish someone would have done this project a long time ago. Amazing how little rain it takes to fill our rain barrel.
•	I have been wanting to put together a rain barrel for some time, this was perfect timing. Several of my family have seen this in use and want one or more for themselves. Thank you!
•	For water-shy western KS, this is a great project for water awareness.
•	After the first rain and seeing how much rain was collected, we got another barrel and hooked it up to the first barrel. We put it a little lower than the first barrel and connected the overflow from the first into the top of the second. It didn't take long for even the second barrel to get filled. Absolutely amazing!!!
•	It was great, look forward to the next one!

These comments by participants of the pilot event show the need and importance of implementing this watershed wide.  

We will use the same survey once again using Survey Monkey to get feedback and suggestions for future events.  

Our past experience with implementing a project watershed wide was positive. The CoCoRaHS (Community, Collaborative, Rain, Hail, and Snow Network) Precipitation project tells us that doing something across the watersheds helps build partnerships and a sense of belonging and makes everyone feel they are contributing to water quality protection efforts.

In Oak Creek HUC 12 Subwatershed, we will be focusing on the TMDL load parameters:  1)Nitrates; 3) Phosphorus; and 3) E. coli bacteria.

Overall WRAPS Plan Goal:  Meet the KDHE suggested benchmark TMDL standards as follows:  Nitrate -- 1.25 ppm; E.coli -- 262 cfu/100 ml -- primary contact for recreation; or E. coli -- 3,843 cfu/100mL in rivers and lakes; Phosphorus -- 0.15 ppm; and Total Suspended Solids -- 100 ppm.  It may not be possible to meet the suggested benchmark TMDL standards, so reductions will be met according to goals below.  

According to our Water Quality Monitoring Project, the overall 2008 Mean Goal water quality monitoring levels in Oak Creek HUC 12 Subwatershed:
Total N:  2.59 ppm
E. coli:  1,957 cfu/100mL (seasonal values can reach up to 8,259 cfu/100mL) geomean
Total P:  0.51 ppm
TSS:  122.3 ppm

Goal:  Reduce nitrates, phosphorus, and E. coli bacteria.

#2  Educate landowners, tenants, citizens, youth, and city/county elected officials on the importance of changing daily habits to increase the likelihood of making better choices in regards to protecting and improving local water resources. 


By transitioning the existing programs into the new WATERS program, there will be a consistent message portrayed to all watershed residents.  A message that signifies the importance of everyone working together for the benefit common drinking and recreation water sources.



Objectives
Relocate feeding sites away from water sources. 

#2  In looking at ways to continue existing programs while being cost-effective, the BCMSHRW Leadership Team wants to create and establish a Watershed Actions To Enhance Resource Stewardship (WATERS) program.  WATERS will encompass all ages of watershed residents from youth to adult, from the preschool student to the college level student, and include the local rural landowner and the urban resident.  WATERS will bring together community and school based water festivals and partner them with college level service learning opportunities. This will include and bring together at one event rural, agricultural, and urban citizens to better understand the environmental impacts each has on their surroundings and how different lifestyles contribute both positively and negatively to water quality.  In addition, we will highlight how urban pollution can affect agricultural practices and visa versa with how the two create overall water quality issues. 


Methods
The WRAPS Leadership Team will relocate at least 3 feeding sites.  In addition, we will work with the producer to clean and clear the abandoned feeding sites.

The WRAPS Leadership Team will partner with County Conservation Districts, Buffer Coordinators, and NRCS Field Offices in getting producers to sign-up land in need of best management practices for water quality improvements. Producers eligible for WRAPS demonstration dollars will be those with the highest ranking in the prioritized Landowner Decision Making Team's list.  All other producers interested in best management practices will be worked with for other local, state, and federal programs.  

#2  Projects in place as of January 2009 that will be moved into the WATERS program for this grant cycle include: 

·         Watershed Monitoring Project (41 sites as of January 2009 – samples collected for Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, E. coli, and Total Suspended Solids.  Samples collected after 0.50” rainfall events in urban areas and 1.50” in rural areas.  A TMDL sweep of 5 samples in 30 days completed on a quarterly (seasonal) basis).  This used to be subcontracted to Forty Hays State University (FHSU) but in the last year, the WRAPS project has purchased equipment to run a portion of the analysis ourselves.  It should be noted that we still have access to a locked down laboratory at FHSU with FHSU donating a large majority of equipment, space, and overhead to the project.  Due to running the analysis ourselves, we've had to start purchasing the consumables used to run the analysis, so therefore, a subcontract to FHSU is not feasible.  We will still continue the monitoring program but will pay for the project out of our grant funds.



·         Community, Collaborative, Rain, Hail, & Snow Network (CoCoRaHS).  One-hundred three (103) precipitation stations within the watersheds that help determine need to collect water samples and correlate rainfall with pollutant loading.



·         www.MyKansasWatershed.com (project website) -- This is updated on a regular basis with projects, activities, upcoming events, educational materials, precipitation data, monitoring data, and much more. 



·         In addition, the results of all the monitoring data from inception to the end of the 2009 TMDL sweep will be written for publication in an National Extension Journal (June 2010) and for printing in a KSU Extension Publication (March 2010). 



·         Construction of the Watershed on Wheels (WOW) trailer in cooperation with FHSU as a Service Learning Project with unveiling by January 2010. 



Due to budget cuts, the following programs, informational and educational projects, will only happen if outside funding is leveraged.
Information & Education – accountability and reporting to watershed residents including: producers, landowners, elected officials, partners, and organizations.  Accomplished via displays, booths, speaking engagements at watershed events, radio programs, newsletters, direct mailings, and newspapers (news articles, feature stories, coverage,  and progress reports in the annual special editions of watershed newspapers, i.e., County Conservation editions; Home & Garden editions; Kanopolis Lake Guide; Water Conservation editions, etc.).  

Youth through Adult Programs and Events.  Includes annual community-based water festival in Hays, bi-annual community based water festival in Ellis, school based water festivals annually in Hays and Victoria, Service Learning Projects with Fort Hays State University, annual Wonders of Wetlands, Water, & Wildlife Conservation Tour at Kanopolis Lake, annual Kids Ag-Days in Trego, Ellis, & Ellsworth Counties, bi-annual wildflower and water tour, presentations at community organizations, and the annual Hays Home & Garden Show.

"335","items",NA,"KS",59880,"CWN: Rural Lakes LEPG-Onsite Wastewater/Private Water Well Survey","$5,600","Overview
Rural Lakes Region is applying for a Clean Water Neighbor Grant to encompass the six county Rural Lakes Region LEPP (Clay, Cloud, Geary, Marshall, Morris and Washington).  During SFY 1990, Geary County formed a multi-county local environmental protection group called ""Rural Lakes Region"".  The lead agency for the Rural Lakes Region LEPP is the Junction City/Geary County Health Department.  The Junction City/Geary Health Department operating as Rural Lakes LEPG implements the environmental code for each of the seven participating counties and manage the LEPP grant awarded annually for this program.

The proposed project would utilize the use of GIS data mapping of private water wells and onsite wastewater systems within the Rural Lakes Region.  Our six county region encompasses the Solomon, Smoky-Hill Saline, Neosho and Lower Republic River basins.  Included are the Lower Little & Big Blue and Clarks Creek WRAPS.  Data would be coordinated with the six county conservation districts, local planning commissions, WRAPS and BACs.

The Clarks Creek WRAPS has an identified TMDL for fecal coliform bacteria.  In addition, the wells for Morris County RWD #1 are located at the bottom of Clarks Creek Watershed.  The wells at this point have continued to provide a safe water source, however, actions taken by WRAPS for reducing bacteria and other pollution loads are a priority for WRAPS projects.  Identified location of onsite wastewater systems is not documented.  


The Lower Big Blue and Little Blue WRAPS has an identified TMDL for sediment, bacteria and nutrients.  Section 5.2.1.C of the Lower Big Blue and Little Blue WRAPS Project addresses onsite wastewater systems and the location and condition of these systems is largely unknown.


Objectives
Through this grant, identifying, locating and determining the condition of systems within the watershed would be addressed.

Through the continuous update of onsite wastewater system and private water well data, specific location and inventory data will be available for use by the conservations districts and each WRAPS entity for identification of problem areas for non-point pollution sources.


Methods
Files for onsite wateswater systems and private water wells in the are accurate from 2000 to the current date in the six county Rural Lakes Region LEPG area.  The Conservation District Offices, WRAPS project coordinators, local planning commissions, and BACs frequently contact Rural Lakes LEPG for current information on the location and status of onsite wastewater systems and private water wells.  A request will be made to all counties and conservation district offices for all current onsite wastewater and private water well data for their area.  Additional data will be obtained from the KGS.  The GIS units will be used to collect location data during field activities to include additional systems that are not currently in these databases.  This data will then be compiled into a single database.

The proposed project would utilize the use of GIS data mapping of private water wells and onsite wastewater systems within the Rural Lakes Region.  Data would be coordinated with the six county conservation districts, local planning commissions, WRAPS and BACs.

Local WRAPS include, Clarks Creek, Milford Lake, Tuttle Creek, Twin Lakes, Neosho River Basin, Lower Republican, and Little and Big Blue.

Data will be available to all participating counties and available on the Rural Lakes Website when completed.","N","Project Implementation","10260006","102600060604","N","10/01/2010","Accepted by EPA","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:59880"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,5600

This activity is designed to provide engineering support for accelerated implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) in western North Carolina and continues work funded under the FY90-96 Section 319(h) grants. Water quality problems related to concentrated animal feeding operations and trout farms have been documented in the TVA counties and other counties in western North Carolina. North Carolina administers an Agriculture Cost Share Program which provides financial assistance to farmers to implement BMPs specifically for water quality protection.

Objectives
This program has been very popular among farmers, but the program has been limited by the availability of engineering assistance needed to properly design waste management systems for animal operations and trout farms. Providing this engineering support will accelerate the number of BMPs which can be implemented and will help farmers comply with the nondischarge rule for animal waste management adopted by the Environmental Management Commission in December 1992. Technical assistance would also be more readily available for future trout and animal farms to be designed so that water quality is protected. The cost of these activities will be shared with the Tennessee Valley Authority and local Soil and Water Conservation Districts.

This watershed restoration project is focused on the Hyatt Creek Watershed in Haywood County, NC. The goal of this project is to improve water quality in Hyatt Creek and remove it from the 303(d) list of impaired waters. Hyatt Creek is on the list due to sedimentation and siltation. Using GIS technology and an Integrated Pollutant Source Identification data set to identify non-point sources and integrating a series of Best Management Practices to address watershed issues will provide a holistic approach to improving a severely degraded stream. This approach combined with a high degree of collaboration, including local state and federal government agencies, provide the local support, stakeholder buy in and financial resources that are necessary to begin healing a watershed after years of abuse.A comprehensive monitoring program will be implemented to demonstrate measurable results. Outreach and the results of this project will be disseminated through publications, presentations, and sharing our experiences with individual groups, watershed organizations and local governments. Hyatt Creek has significant recreation and economic implications for the County. However, sediment and other pollutants are impacting the stream. Sources of impairment include animal feeding operations, stream bank erosion, limited riparian vegetation, storm water erosion, leaking septic tanks, development and possibly landfill leachings and a NPDES discharger.The project partners drafted a Watershed Action Plan to guide restoration efforts. BMPs include animal feeding operations fencing, alternative water sources, stream bank stabilization, riparian buffer plantings, implementing storm water erosion control, septic tank discharger repair, working with a state agency to monitor discharge from a closed landfill, creating low-impact development designs, supporting compliance efforts for NPDES permitting, and supporting regulatory compliance. The main goal of this project is to improve water quality in Hyatt Creek to the degree that it can be removed from the 303(d) list of impaired waters. Integrating BMPs to address storm water issues, restore eroding stream banks, improve riparian areas, eliminate animal access to streams and eliminate sources of animal and human waste will provide a holistic approach to improving a severely degraded stream. This approach combined with the high degree of collaboration between local agencies and organizations, and all levels of government demonstrates what can be achieved when all cooperate on an important project. It also provides the local support, stakeholder buy in and financial resources that are necessary to begin healing a watershed after years of abuse. A partnership was formed with the goal of removing Hyatt Creek from the 303(d) list. The key partners are the Southwestern NC Resource Conservation and Development Council (RC&D), Haywood Waterways Association (HWA), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Haywood Soil and Water Conservation District (HSWCD), NC Department of Transportation (DOT), USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and NC Wildlife Resources Commission (WRC). EPA will assist with NPDES permitting and regulatory compliance.The partners will use GIS technology and the HWA Integrated Pollutant Source Identification (IPSI) data set to analyze the watershed and prioritize restoration activities. This digital database of non-point sources enables us to plan, assess and share information about water quality issues and watershed improvements. It also encourages cooperation among conservation organizations and agencies and it adds a degree of credibility to conclusions reached by the partners. This state of the art technology combined with a broad based coalition of stakeholders and all levels of government make this a truly unique opportunity to demonstrate what can be accomplished to restore a watershed.This watershed restoration project is focused on the Hyatt Creek Watershed in Haywood County, NC. Hyatt Creek is within the Pigeon River Watershed (8-digit HUC = 06010106) and is on the state's 303(d) list of impaired waters due to sedimentation and siltation. Hyatt Creek is one of EPA Region Four Priority Watersheds and was identified by the NC DENR, Division of Water Quality as one of 28 watersheds in the French Broad River Basin with the greatest need and opportunity for stream restoration efforts.Hyatt Creek is a third order, headwater stream (2-3 m wide) within the 2,400 acre (3.75 mi2) Hyatt Creek Watershed. The stream is 3.5 miles long and has nearly two miles of tributaries. The watershed is mostly rural but housing and commercial developments are increasing. Paved and unpaved roads follow Hyatt Creek for its entire length. Commercial enterprises include a hotel, car dealership, an industrial complex under renovation, and 56 acres of prime undeveloped commercial land located near the mouth of the creek. Rapid development at this commercial site is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The stream has been extensively channelized at its downstream reaches.Hyatt Creek has direct impact on Richland Creek, a stream with significant economic implications for Haywood County, the Town of Waynesville and the Lake Junaluska Assembly. Richland Creek provides aesthetic value and high quality water for recreation. Trout fishing attracts thousands of visitors each year. Richland Creek supports good populations of trout and is managed as Hatchery Supported Trout Waters by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission (WRC). Richland Creek also flows into Lake Junaluska, a popular recreation center and retreat that provides over $40 million per year to the local economy. Sediment and other pollutants are reducing the aesthetic quality of Hyatt and Richland Creeks, removing valuable agricultural land, and incurring significant costs for downstream users. The IPSI data set indicates many areas of the Hyatt Creek watershed are losing 2.5 tons of soil/acre/yr, with some areas exceeding 10 tons/acre/year. The Lake Junaluska Assembly estimated it would cost $2 million to remove the sediment that has settled in Lake Junaluska, but that would only be a temporary fix. The high sediment loads have resulted in a 303(d) listing for Richland Creek below the Lake Junaluska dam. Volunteer Water Information Network (VWIN) sampling has consistently found high turbidity, TSS and nutrient concentrations that result in a poor rating for Hyatt Creek. Samples collected by DWQ after several days of dry weather found fecal coliform counts greater than 2,000/100ml in Hyatt Creek.Five sources of impairment were identified in the Hyatt Creek watershed (in order of priority): (1) animal feeding operations (including one concentrated animal feeding operation), (2) stream bank erosion, (3) limited riparian vegetation, (4) storm water erosion, and (5) leaking septic tanks. There are also potential sources from: (6) landfill leachings, (7) undeveloped commercial land, and (8) a NPDES discharger. This project will address each of these sources.The partners drafted a Hyatt Creek Watershed Action Plan (the Plan) to guide restoration efforts. The Plan supplements the HWA Pigeon River Watershed Action Plan published March 2002. The long-term water quality improvement goals of the Plan are: (1) improve water quality and remove Hyatt Creek from the 303(d) list; (2) protect water quality for downstream landowner uses; (3) support trout populations in Richland Creek; (4) reduce water quality and economic impacts to Richland Creek and Lake Junaluska; and (5) provide clean water for recreation. The short-term water quality improvement goals are: (1) gather public support through newspaper articles, press releases, and public presentations; (2) collect reference stream water quality data; and (3) complete one project to establish precedence for other projects.The partners already have many accomplishments in the Hyatt Creek Watershed. This is the seventh year the VWIN program has been monitoring two sites on Hyatt Creek monthly. VWIN parameters include pH, alkalinity, turbidity, TSS, conductivity, metals (Cu, Pb and Zn), and nutrients (ortho-P, NH3-N, and NO3-N). In addition, HWA has collected storm water suspended sediment data for the past three years, DWQ has collected fecal coliform and benthic macroinvertebrate data, and TVA has collected benthic macroinvertebrate and fish data. In cooperation with SWCD, BMPs have been implemented for animal feeding operations and individual homeowners. These include holding ponds, irrigation systems, 800 linear feet (lf) of stream bank stabilization, twelve acres of pasture improvements, 800 lf of riparian buffer plantings, 1600 lf of animal feeding operation fencing, three alternative water sources and removal of 5 animal access points. NRCS and HSWCD have also created plans for stabilizing 3,150 lf of stream banks, waste management plans for 2 animal feeding operations, and storm water management plans for 1 animal feeding operation. In addition to the above accomplishments, the Haywood County Council has recently solicited advice from the partners on steps that can be taken to reduce the impacts of future growth in the Hyatt and Richland Creek watersheds.   This will provide an opportunity to work with the local government to shape future growth in the upper reaches of the Hyatt Creek water and protect the stream restoration efforts being funded through this grant.

Objectives
This watershed restoration project will improve a severely degraded watershed. The goal is to remove Hyatt Creek from the 303(d) list of impaired waters. The partners have developed a work plan outlining the use of a series of BMPs. A comprehensive monitoring program will be implemented to demonstrate the measurable results of the BMP components. Our outreach program will educate others through publications, presentations and field tours. The results of this project will be disseminated through a written report, publications in newspapers, magazines and peer-reviewed journals; presentations at local, regional and if requested, national symposiums; and sharing our experiences with individual watershed organizations and local governments.The current IPSI database used in planning this project was created in 1999 for HWA. The data set covered the entire Pigeon River Watershed in Haywood County, NC. It is a digital database of non-point pollution sources and continues to be used to plan, assess, and share information about water quality issues and watershed improvement projects. The database encourages coordination between agencies and organizations on issues ranging from BMPs to conservation plans for landowners. This coordination gives credibility to water resource concerns and encourages cooperation on addressing water quality issues.The two major floods in 2004, resulting from hurricanes Francis and Ivan, significantly changed many streams and watersheds in Haywood County. These storms rendered some of the 1999 IPSI data obsolete. New roads and development have increased imperviousness and exacerbated storm water problems in rapidly developing areas like Hyatt Creek. A portion of this project and grant request are targeted for updating the IPSI database. The monitoring line items in the project budget and related application questions are larger than normal due to the inclusion of the IPSI update.There are 9 BMPs that will address the sources of impairment: (1) animal feeding operations fencing and alternative water source, (2) stream bank stabilization, (3) riparian buffer plantings, (4) implementing storm water erosion control, (5) septic tank discharger repair, (6) working with a state agency to monitor discharge from a closed landfill, (7) creating low-impact development designs, (8) supporting compliance efforts for NPDES permitting, and (9) supporting regulatory compliance. Measurable results will be assessed through VWIN sampling, fecal coliform counts, evaluating the benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities, and on-the-ground work performed. HWA will collect VWIN data at the 2 existing sites and 3 additional VWIN sites. DWQ will assess fecal coliforms at each of the 5 VWIN sites. TVA will evaluate benthic macroinvertebrates once each year at the VWIN sites and fish once each year near the downstream end of the watershed. Fecal coliform counts, sediment, nutrient concentrations and benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities will be compared to established standards to determine if goals are being met. The state standard for fecal coliforms is 200/100 ml. The state turbidity standard is 50 NTU for streams not designated as trout waters. No standard for TSS exists, but values below 30 mg/L are low and 100 mg/L are high in western North Carolina mountain streams. Hyatt Creek received VWIN grades of D for turbidity and TSS. That means the median value of turbidity was greater than 10 NTU and exceeded 50 NTU in more than 10% of samples, and the median value of TSS was greater than 10 mg/L and exceeded 100 mg/L in more than 10% of samples. Hyatt Creek received VWIN grades of C for ortho-phosphate, ammonia-nitrogen and nitrate/nitrite – nitrogen. No water quality standards exist for ortho-phosphate but 0.05 mg/l is generally accepted as a standard. VWIN data for Hyatt Creek found concentrations averaged 0.15 mg/L in 2004. Normal ambient concentrations of ammonia-nitrogen are approximately 0.10 mg/l and Hyatt Creek averaged 0.15 mg/L. For nitrate/nitrite – nitrogen, water quality standards are 10 mg/l. Even though Hyatt Creek samples never exceeded 5 mg/L, both sites received a C because Hyatt Creek had the highest nitrate/nitrite – nitrogen loadings in Haywood County, which were also significantly higher than the regional average (0.6 mg/L).Benthic macroinvertebrate and fish community improvements will be determined by comparison with baseline DWQ and TVA data and with reference stream data. Improvements will be defined as increased equitability and similarity to reference stream conditions.At the end of each year, we will assess the effectiveness of the BMPs implemented along Hyatt Creek and its tributaries. The monitoring program will enable us to assess the project’s success.Proposed BMPs:BMP #1: Animal feeding operations fencing and alternative water source Description: The IPSI data identified animal access points as sediment sources in the Hyatt Creek Watershed. DWQ’s 2005 French Broad Basinwide Plan recommends limiting livestock access to streams to restore in-stream habitat and riparian buffer conditions and improve Hyatt Creek. Constructing fences, heavy-use feeding areas, feed/waste structures and providing alternative water sources will prevent livestock from accessing stream banks, consuming riparian vegetation, trampling stream banks and excreting waste directly or in close proximity to the stream. This will enable suitable riparian buffer vegetation to be established and reduce or prevent erosion, sedimentation, nutrient concentrations, and fecal coliform counts. This BMP will be implemented at five animal feeding operations, including one concentrated animal feeding operation.Output: Implementing this BMP will require constructing 5,055 lf of fencing, three heavy-use feeding areas, two feed/waste structures and three alternative water sources. HSWCD and the partners will work with the cooperating landowners on a cost-share basis. This work will coincide with the stream bank stabilization and riparian buffer plantings BMPs. BMP #2: Stream bank stabilizationDescription: The IPSI data identified stream bank erosion as a primary source of sediment in the Hyatt Creek Watershed. Biological sampling by TVA indicated poor to fair fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities, which they attributed to several factors including sedimentation resulting from bank instability (French Broad River Basinwide Water Quality Plan, May 2000). Stabilizing stream banks will prevent erosion and sedimentation. BMPs will include rock veins, bank shaping, root wads, and other natural material treatment techniques. Specific BMPs will be determined through engineering studies on a site-by-site basis. Three landowners will benefit from stream bank stabilization. The undeveloped commercial property will also benefit. This property is currently for sale. TVA will coordinate with HWA and the developer on creating low-impact development (LID) plans once the property is sold (see BMP #7). Additional funding will then be sought to implement 2,500 lf of stream bank stabilization.Output: Implementing this BMP will require stream bank stabilization of 3,450 lf and creating LID plans for 2,500 lf. HSWCD and the partners will work with the cooperating landowners on a cost-share basis. This work will coincide with the animal feeding operation fencing and riparian buffer plantings BMPs. BMP #3: Riparian buffer plantingsDescription: The IPSI data identified areas with marginal or inadequate riparian vegetation as sources of sediment in the Hyatt Creek watershed. Several studies by DWQ and TVA support this finding (French Broad River Basinwide Water Quality Plans, May 2000 and 2005; Biological Monitoring of Hominy Creek and Hyatt Creek - TMDL studies, May 2002). Restoring riparian buffer vegetation will provide stream bank stability, flood plain protection, and treatment of storm water sheet flow for 5 landowners. Improvements will reduce or prevent erosion, sedimentation, nutrification and fecal coliforms contamination to Hyatt Creek. The undeveloped commercial property will also benefit from riparian buffer plantings. TVA will coordinate with HWA and the developer to create LID plans once the property is sold. Additional funding will then be sought to implement plantings covering 5,000 lf.Output: Implementing this BMP will require planting riparian vegetation along 5,375 lf of stream and creating LID plans for 5,000 lf. HSWCD and the partners will work with the cooperating landowners on a cost-share basis. This work will coincide with the animal feeding operation fencing and stream bank stabilization BMPs. BMP #4: Implementing storm water erosion controlDescription: The IPSI data identified 9,600 lf of eroding roads, ditches and road banks as significant sources of sediment in the Hyatt Creek Watershed. These areas are located in housing developments and on state maintained roads. The stabilization of these sources will reduce storm water runoff and erosion at the site and prevent erosion downstream. BMPs may include check dams, stabilization with permanent vegetation, grass-lined ditches, drop boxes, and sediment traps. Specific BMPs will be determined by engineering studies on a site-by-site basis. NC DOT has agreed to survey the state roads and ditches in the watershed and develop a timeline for the implementation of the appropriate BMPs to reduce potential sources of sediment on state rights of way. DOT has pledged $10,000 for this project and will install the selected BMPs on state road rights of way.Output: Implementing this BMP for individual landowners will require surveying the road systems and ditches for storm water runoff issues, developing and implementing storm water management plans and installing storm water BMPs on a cost-share basis. DOT will identify problem areas on state-maintained roads, develop a timeline and install BMPs.BMP #5: Septic tank discharger repairDescription: According to the IPSI data set, field reconnaissance, and the Haywood County Health Department, there are several septic systems in need of repair and gray water discharges. Repairs will include construction of drain fields, standard systems, and alternative systems. These repairs will reduce nutrient concentrations and fecal coliform contamination to Hyatt Creek. Output: Implementing this BMP will require surveying properties in the Hyatt Creek Watershed for septic system discharges (failed septic systems) and gray water discharges, and providing corrective measure on a cost-share basis. DENR will provide financial assistance through the WaDE program for qualifying homeowners and conduct the field survey. This work will be coordinated with the Haywood County Health Department and DENR Department of Environmental Health.BMP #6: Working with a state agency to monitor discharge from a closed landfillDescription: The EPA STORET database indicates elevated metal concentrations in Richland Creek downstream of the Hyatt Creek confluence. We will work with the NC Solid Waste Program to determine if detected metals are associated with groundwater discharges from the Town of Hazelwood abandoned landfill at the headwaters to the Hyatt Creek Watershed. Improvements will reduce contaminant concentrations in Hyatt Creek and other downstream waterways. Output: Implementing this BMP will require monthly monitoring of metals at two sites adjacent to the landfill. BMP #7: Creating low impact development (LID) designsDescription: The IPSI data indicated riparian buffer plantings and stream bank stabilization are needed for the section of Hyatt Creek flowing through the undeveloped commercial property. This site will require approximately 5,000 lf of plantings to cover both sides of the stream and 2,500 lf of stream bank stabilization. The land is currently for sale and no construction projects will be funded as part of this project grant request. HWA and TVA will work with the seller to inform prospective buyers of the benefits of LID and that LID designs are available for the site. When the land is sold, TVA and the partners will coordinate with the developer on LID plans. Additional funding will then be sought to implement stream bank stabilizations and riparian buffer plantings.Output: Implementing this BMP will require working with the, seller and developer to identify needs, creating LID designs and identifying alternate funding sources. BMP #8: Supporting compliance efforts for NPDES permittingDescription: The project partners will cooperate with DENR and EPA regarding compliance with the NPDES package plant permit for a trailer park on Hyatt Creek. Any effort to assist the park owners will be done with EPA and DENR approval. Improvements will prevent or reduce nutrient and fecal loadings to the stream. No part of this grant will be used to fund EPA actions.Output: EPA will review the operational history of the wastewater treatment package plant for the trailer park on Hyatt Creek. If necessary, new upgrades or repairs would be implemented on a cost-share basis with the park owner.BMP #9: Supporting regulatory complianceDescription: Regulatory compliance issues will be addressed by DENR DWQ and EPA. RC&D, HWA and local partners will defer to DWQ and EPA for any enforcement decision or action. However, the partners will work with regulatory agencies to assist in compliance with statutes, regulations and policies that will restore and protect water quality. Improvements from this BMP may include reduced soil erosion, sedimentation, nutrient loadings and fecal coliform contamination. No part of this grant will be used to fund EPA actions.Output: If regulatory compliance is needed, implementing this BMP may require constructing animal feeding operation fencing, alternative water sources, stream bank stabilization, and riparian buffer plantings. Project Schedule: Work will begin within 1 month of funding. Water quality samples will be collected monthly for VWIN data, twice each year for fecal coliform counts, and annually for evaluating the benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities. One-third of the construction work will be completed each year for 3 years. Low-impact development designs and finding alternate sources of funding to implement the designs will be completed by year 3. Metals data from monitoring landfill leachate will be reported to the NC Solid Waste Program each year for 3 years. Work for compliance issues will occur as requested by the regulatory agencies. At the end of each year, the partners will assess the effectiveness of the BMPs implemented along Hyatt Creek and its tributaries. Annual assessment reports will be sent to all partners, including DENR, EPA and the NC Solid Waste Program.Total Project Cost: With this application, we are requesting $500,000 from the EPA 319 Incremental Fund. RC&D and the partners have secured $364,210 in matching funds (including the $20,000 NRCS federal match) or in-kind services from DENR, TVA, RC&D (NC CWMTF Grants), NRCS, HSWCD, DOT, HWA and cost-share dollars and/or in-kind contributions from landowners. HWA will also seek $50,000 from the Pigeon River Fund for the IPSI update (they funded the first IPSI). The project budget and budget notes provide itemized details of the project costs. 

Methods
The following measurable results are anticipated from the Hyatt Creek Watershed Restoration project: (1) Achieve VWIN grades of A and reduce nutrient concentrations below water quality standards or regional reference values for orthophosphate (<0.05 mg/L), ammonia-nitrogen (<0.10 mg/L) and nitrate/nitrite-nitrogen (<0.6 mg/L). Nutrient concentrations will be reduced 25% by the fourth quarter, 50% by the eighth quarter, and all concentrations will be at the regional reference value or below water quality standards by the twelfth quarter.(2) Eliminate non-natural sources of fecal coliform contamination. Fecal coliform counts will be reduced 50% by the sixth quarter and all samples will be less than NCDWQ water quality standards by the twelfth quarter (<200 colonies/100ml).(3) Achieve VWIN grades of A for turbidity and TSS and reduce measurements below water quality standards or regional reference values. Turbidity and TSS will be reduced 25% by the fourth quarter, 50% by the eighth quarter, and all concentrations will be at the regional reference value or below water quality standards by the twelfth quarter. (4) Restore the biological integrity of Hyatt Creek. Biological integrity will be measured through the Index of Biotic Integrity and the EPT Taxa Richness indices. The benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities will exhibit a 50% improvement compared to reference conditions by the eighth quarter, and 100% improvement by the twelfth quarter.(5) Complete LID plans for the commercial property. (6) Complete an evaluation of metal composition in landfill leachate. (7) Milestones for regulatory compliance support will depend on compliance issues, if any. Possible milestones may be new upgrades or repairs to equipment, or quantity of animal feeding operation fencing, alternative water sources, stream bank stabilization, and riparian buffer plantings constructed.","Y","Project Implementation","06010105","060101051402","N","02/01/2006","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:16402"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,"HaywoodWaterwaysWatershedRestorationPlan","Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)",5e+05

Mud Creek, in Henderson County, (Figure 1.1), and two of its tributaries, Clear Creek and Bat Fork, are currently on the North Carolina 303(d) List of Impaired Waterbodies  

Studies by the Division of Water Quality (DWQ) and the Tennessee Valley Authority reveal that erosion and sedimentation is one of the primary causes of degradation of streams in the Mud Creek Watershed (see # 27 for references).  

Additional causes of impairment are identified as channelization, lack of riparian vegetation, and stormwater run-off from accelerated increase in impervious surfaces throughout the watershed.  Pesticides from agricultural land-use (apple orchards and row crops), are also identified as likely contributors to impairment.

In 2000, the Land of Sky Regional Council of Governments convened local stakeholders in the Mud Creek watershed to combine stream conservation efforts and formed the Mud Creek Watershed Restoration Council.

A variety of efforts are currently in progress to address the problems in the Mud Creek watershed.  Intense public education has been carried out for about 18 months.  Coordination work has helped identify potential stream restoration and Best Management Practices (BMPs) for appropriate Federal, State, and non-profit agencies for conservation easements, buffer protection or installation, BMPs for livestock or row crops, etc.  Stream restoration projects by the Ecosystem Enhancement Program have been identified and are slated for the next three years.  A variety of conservation easements have been secured by the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy to protect high quality natural areas within the watershed.  Funding has been secured to implement a variety of BMPs within the Lewis Creek subwatershed to stabilize streambanks, help reduce pesticide use, and stabilize eroding soils that may contain legacy pesticides.

These efforts provide a good start at addressing the monumental task of removing Mud Creek from the 303(d) list.  However, in pursuing the above listed projects, a new need has been identified for work that continually falls through the cracks of the various Federal and state programs available for watershed protection and stream restoration:

Across Western North Carolina, fast-paced land development and recent hurricane damage have increased the incidence of badly eroding streams.  These eroding sites contribute a significant amount of sediment to the stream system, but they contribute it in small, incremental amounts, spread out throughout the watershed.  There is a great need for small-scale stream stabilization throughout the region.  This need has created a demand for professionals to carry out this work.  While large-scale government-funded projects contract with big engineering firms to restore stream channels in 1/4 mile+ increments, a void exists for homeowners seeking assistance in fixing relatively small-scale blow-outs on backyard and neighborhood streams.  These projects are too small to qualify for stream restoration by the Ecosystem Enhancement Program (a minimum of 1500 linear feet is required), and they are too small to be financially feasible as conservation easements with the local land trust (a requirement of the Clean Water Management Trust Fund).  Homeowners are left to address their erosion problems independently.  

At the same time, installing high quality stream stabilization measures, even at a relatively small scale, requires technical knowledge that is beyond the scope of most homeowners.  They do their best, using stop-gap measures such as rip-rap, wire fencing, concrete, and other old-school stabilization techniques that often do more harm to stream ecosystems and aquatic habitat.  If they seek professional assistance, engineering firms are too expensive for the average homeowner, plus small backyard projects are usually not financially worthwhile for such firms.  Many homeowners turn to professional landscapers for assistance with problems related to drainage.  However, most landscapers lack up-to-date knowledge of best practices for stream stabilization to enhance aquatic habitat.  

High quality stream repair uses elements of natural channel design to the greatest extent possible.  The goal is not only to repair eroding spots and prevent future erosion, but also to return natural features and processes to streams to enhance the quality of habitat and other environmental functions they provide.

Designing a high quality stream repair requires analyzing dimension, pattern and profile of the stream; understanding channel features and biological considerations; assessing average and peak stream flow; and considering the hydrology and topology of the surrounding site.

Many landscapers have never studied stream ecology or hydrology, they have no familiarity with stream functions, and they are not familiar with the currently recommended materials and structures for high quality streambank stabilization.  Many landscapers today continue to recommend old-school practices that use non-natural materials and often send the problem downstream.  

There is a great need for training in stream repair for contractors involved in earthmoving, planting, or landscape design to build local capacity for carrying out small-scale streambank stabilization projects that do not meet the criteria for projects by state agencies.

This grant seeks funding for training workshops, hands-on field work, and advice and consultation from a mentor to train landscapers to do high quality stream repair using established best practices.  The goal is to build a cadre of local professionals whom homeowners can hire to assist with backyard stream repair, who will conduct such repairs using the best practices identified by current research.

In February, 2005, a one-day Stream Dr. workshop was planned and carried out by the Mud Creek Restoration Project/Cooperative Extension Service (applicant for this grant), with the assistance of NCSU Extension Specialists.  The workshop demonstrated great interest and demand for this type of training among the professional landscaper community.  Over 50 participants attended, at least 10 were turned away due to lack of seating space, and a waiting list currently exists for a repeat of the workshop.  

This workshop was conducted on a shoe-string budget.  No funds were available for any hands-on work, and limited printed material was provided.  While the workshop was a great success as a pilot effort, there is a danger in providing merely 8 hours of training, and then sending novices out to solicit stream repair work, with no follow-up, support, or assistance as they begin implementing streambank stabilization for the first time.  There is a great possibility that errors in design and implementation may cause further degradation of streams.  

A more comprehensive training program is needed that would provide an opportunity for trainees to work side-by-side with experienced experts, to gain hands-on experience in designing and installing a stabilization project, including all the permitting procedures.  In addition, continued support is needed in the form of mentoring, to provide advice and consultation on the first few projects trainees undertake on their own, to be able to double-check designs, choice of materials, and installation plans with seasoned experts.


Objectives
With this grant we will develop and carry out a comprehensive training program for landscapers to provide the necessary background information, hands-on experience, and expert support to begin building a cadre of local service-providers to design and carry out small-scale backyard streambank stabilization.The training program will consist of three tiers:Tier I:  One 8-hour workshop covering the background information needed for high quality stream repair.  Topics include:- Stream Functions and Stability- Options for Stabilizing Streams - Healthy Vegetation for Streambanks - Growing and Installing Plants for Mountain Streams - Permitting for Stream Work- Tour of eroding sites with discussion on choosing the best repair strategy – what would the Stream Dr. do?Tier II:  Hands-on repair/stabilization of one eroding stream site, with active participation of up to fifteen trainees.  Trainees would work in small workgroups with NCSU Extension Specialists (5-6 trainees per specialist) to review the site, create the design plan, complete the permit applications, procure the materials and equipment, and do the actual installation.  This hands-on experience side-by-side with experts is intended to provide an apprentice kind of experience for a trainee’s first streambank stabilization project.Tier III:  Advice and consultation for up to 10 projects by trainees.  In these projects, professional landscapers participating in the program will take on streambank stabilization jobs for homeowners in need of assistance, whose erosion problem does not meet the criteria for restoration under other Federal and State programs.  A marketing brochure will be developed for homeowners to guide them to landscapers participating in the program, to encourage hiring a landscaper who has received training in best practices for streambank stabilization.  Up to $3500 per project will be provided to help cover the cost of materials, or up to 60% of the total cost of the project, whichever is less, as designed and quoted by the landscaper.  This is in keeping with the 40% cost-share design of the 319 program.  NCSU Extension Specialists will be available by phone, fax, and e-mail to discuss the project, review design plans and permit applications, and provide other consulting and advice as the landscaper carries out the project.  This phase is intended to assist trainees in gaining more hands-on experience doing high-quality streambank stabilization while addressing the potential danger of sending novices out to take on stream jobs on their own with no mentoring.  The review process will also ensure that the project cost as quoted to the homeowner is appropriate (that the landscaper does not pad the project cost, based on the $3500 available from the grant.  The $3500 is intended to help make the project more affordable for the homeowner.  In this way, this grant serves as a demonstration project in neighborhoods across the watershed or the county, to initiate a standard for homeowners taking the steps needed to address streambank erosion on their property.This grant has the potential to have a triple impact:  -	11 eroding sites will be stabilized with financial support from this grant.-	Demonstration projects throughout the area will be available as examples to other homeowners to encourage responsible action by private citizens in caring for eroding streams.-	10-15 professionals in the landscape industry will gain knowledge and hands-on experience in designing and installing high quality streambank stabilization projects, addressing the pressing need for LOCAL professionals to assist homeowners with stream erosion problems.  The ability for them to go on to carry out numerous additional projects in the future is a continuing impact of this grant, even after the project itself is completed.  Local capacity building yields on-going returns.The entire project will be managed and coordinated by the Mud Creek Watershed Coordinator.  The coordinator will set up the workshop, managing publicity, registration, and all logistics.  The coordinator will also work to identify candidate sites for the stabilization projects, direct landowners in need of assistance to the participating landscapers in the program, and help facilitate the mentoring process between the Extension Specialists in Raleigh with the trainees in Henderson County (e.g., visit sites with trainees, take photos, prepare GIS maps, etc.  Sites will be chosen from within Henderson County, with priority given to (and a concerted effort made to find) sites within the Mud Creek watershed.  However, there are many eroding stream sites outside of the Mud Creek watershed, which, although they are not in a 303(d) designated watershed, have significant impact on the headwaters of the French Broad River-- a watershed of concern for DWQ --  and on the Green River, a designated scenic river.  

Methods
Effectiveness of stream repairs will be primarily through reporting by the landowner.  Stakes or bank pins may be used to identify continued erosion after repair.  Visual inspection of repair sites by the participating landscapers may be done semi-annually, with reporting on the condition of the site.  Data on each project site (length of stream segment, acreage planted, etc.) will be used in established models to calculate the amount of sediment saved as a result of the work.","Y","Project Implementation","06010105","060101051402","N","01/01/2007","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:24475"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen",46760
"344","items",NA,"NM",33421,"Largo Canyon - Road Maintenance Education","$37,465","Overview
The San Juan River downstream of Largo Canyon is listed by the State of New Mexico Environment Department as impaired by sediment, and the Largo Canyon watershed is thought to be a major source area for this water-quality problem.  Roads in the Largo Canyon watershed probably contribute significant sediment loads to the San Juan River downstream of Largo Canyon. Proper road construction and maintenance is crucial to reduce sediment loading from this area. 

Objectives
The objective of this project is to properly train maintenance crews in construction and maintenance of dirt roads throughout the Largo Canyon field. Proper techniques will lower cost of maintenance long-term and reduce erosion potential.  Reduced erosion will help address the sedimentation problem identified by NMED and will also help reduce salt loading in support of Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum goals.  



Methods
The goals of the project are to 1) create a stakeholders’ group to identify key issues concerning dirt roads in the Largo Canyon Natural Gas Field, 2) successfully conduct two training workshops for road maintenance crews (the same workshop will be held twice to accommodate people’s schedules) that emphasizes newer techniques for higher-quality road maintenance and construction that benefits water quality, and 3) establish Best Management Practices (success) criteria for assuring and monitoring proper construction and maintenance of new and existing roads, and closure of unnecessary roads.  In the process, approximately two miles of road in the Largo Canyon watershed with drainage problems will be upgraded or decommissioned to meet Gold Book guidance, and workshop participants will employ techniques learned in the workshops on two new gas well access roads.

By implementing the Best Management Practices found in this workplan, the San Juan Watershed will benefit by a reduction in loading of E. coli, fecal coliform and plant nutrient loading to the Animas, La Plata and San Juan Rivers.  The reductions in loading, a priority of the SJWG, will improve water quality within the San Juan Watershed.

The education and outreach component of the project will provide greater awareness of the pollutant loading sources and methods to reduce impacts from those sources to the citizens of San Juan County.  The resulting public support for the rivers and voluntary implementation of pollutant reduction techniques by local residents will provide greater protection for the rivers and water quality improvements.

The outreach effort will also increase local awareness of the SJWG and our mission and goals.  This will strengthen the SJWG’s position as an advocate for water quality protection and improvement and increase membership and participation within the group.

Objectives
The SJWG proposes an E. coli pollutant load reduction goal of 1.87 x 1010 cfu/day.  The goal was developed from the Stevens Arroyo Monitoring Report (2006) and the companion Stevens Arroyo Baseline Report (2007).  (Both reports are on the enclosed cd and the monitoring report is available online at the NMED/SWQB website at http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/swqb/wps/San_Juan/StevensArroyoMonitoringReport-2006.pdf.)  E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo is extremely variable during the year.  In 2007 the average E. coli loading to the Stevens Arroyo was 3.00 x 1011 cfu/day.  The SJWG estimates 25% of that loading (7.5 x 1010 E. coli cfu/day) is attributable to the practices of livestock grazing and penning along the Stevens Arroyo and livestock grazing of flood irrigated pastures.  The SJWG goal is to reduce the above loading by 25%. 

...

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local property owners/managers willing to implement appropriate BMPs.  Priority will be given to those areas identified in the Source ID Final Report as significant sources of bacterial and nutrient loading.  Property ownership will be determined through the San Juan County Assessor’s Office and other appropriate sources.  Owner identification and contact information is available from that office.  

Methods
Based on land use and activity, the pollutant load reductions will be achieved by implementing appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs) using two approaches.   The first approach is to work cooperatively with the United Stated Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to implement BMPs with local agricultural producers.  The NRCS administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) which provides cost-share funds to working farms and ranches for conservation improvements.  One of the program’s national priorities is the “reduction of non-point source pollution, such as nutrients, sediment, pesticides, or excess salinity in impaired watersheds, consistent with Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) where available, as well as reduction of groundwater contamination and conservation of ground and surface water resources”.  

The project’s goal will be the implementation of agricultural BMPs on irrigated bottomland located in the valley areas of the watershed adjacent to or in relatively close proximity to the rivers and perennial streams.  The SJWG estimates that this represents approximately 25% of the 29,000 total acres of irrigated lands in the watershed, exclusive of the Navajo Agricultural Products Incorporated (NAPI) lands.  BMPs for these properties include:
•	Manure management
•	Riparian access management for livestock
•	Soil conservation BMPs
•	Conversion to efficient irrigation systems
•	Fertilizer management
•	Vegetated buffers.

The project includes the following activities to accomplish the BMPs. Voluntary implementation of grazing BMPs in the riparian area.  The most effective practices are complete exclusion of livestock from the riparian areas, or the creation of riparian pastures accompanied by careful management of the grazing resource, and provision of off-channel water sources.  

Voluntary implementation of BMPs to increase irrigation efficiencies (30% efficiency for flood irrigation), including irrigation scheduling (to avoid over-application of water – 35 to 40% efficiency), installation of gated irrigation pipe (50% efficiency), installation if sprinkler irrigation (80% efficiency), drip irrigation (95% efficiency) and to decrease irrigation return flows, including land leveling (to permit even watering with less return flow) and tailwater detention (to slow the return of overflow to the stream).  

The BMPs for flood irrigation will reduce bacterial and nutrient loading to the Animas, La Plata and San Juan River by increasing irrigation efficiencies, reducing water usage and reducing irrigation return flows.  Lower, or no, return flows from irrigated pasture and agricultural fields will reduce the quantity of bacteria and nutrients delivered to the receiving stream.  Livestock holding BMPs will remove the livestock from the stream banks and the revegetation of riparian areas will reduce the amount of manure and other animal wastes directly entering the stream and/or river. 

To accomplish the desired goals stated above, the SJWG will work to identify local agricultural producers willing to seek EQIP funding.  EQIP funding is awarded competitively, but the ranking formula awards additional points for projects that benefit a CWA Section 319 funded project.  For the past three years the local work group, which advises the Aztec NRCS office on how to apply the Farm Bill and EQIP funding, has supported awarding additional points above those in the standard ranking formula to those projects identified by the SJWG which result in BMPs that improve water quality in the watershed.  Although total Farm Bill and EQIP funding varies from year to year, a minimum of $30,000 to $40,000 annually is expected to be available for EQIP projects during the term of this proposal.  Currently there are four agricultural producers participating in the EQIP/Section 319 partnership in the SJWG’s current Phase II project.       

For those agricultural producers interested in participating in water quality improvements, the EQIP program typically funds 50% or more of the agricultural producer’s costs.  EQIP funds are determined by NRCS from available price lists to establish maximum reimbursable rates for a wide variety of BMP related activities, such as fencing and irrigation equipment.  The 2010 payment schedule is 75% to 90% of EQIP costlist.  The 2010 payment schedule is available at http://www.nm.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/fotg/section-1/cost-data/2010/2010-costdockets.html.  During the current Phase II project, EQIP funding has varied from 60% to 80% of the project’s total cost.  The CWA Section 319 monies will be used to fund 60% of the producer’s EQIP cost share.

NRCS staff provides technical and design assistance for proposed EQIP projects.  Agricultural producers contract with NRCS to maintain the BMPs and related equipment in proper operating condition for 7 years following installation.  

Permits, certifications and clearances are not anticipated for these projects.  Any work in the riparian area should be conducted in conformance with the United States Army Corps of Engineer’s (ACE) existing nationwide 404 permit.

The second approach will be to identify willing private land owners and/or public entities, such as local and county governments and state and federal land management agencies, not eligible for EQIP to implement appropriate BMPs.  

CWA Section 319 funding will be used for property owners who are not agricultural producers but engaged in agricultural activity to implement the same BMPs identified above. (EQIP funding is only available to individuals who are engaged in agriculture for income.  Non-producers are individuals who do not derive income from their agricultural activities.  These include hobby farmers and individuals who have horses and other livestock for pleasure or personal consumption.)  Funding will also be used for private and public property owners/managers to implement stormwater management, stream channel and steam bed improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration BMPs.  The following stormwater related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Pervious surface installation in the urban environment in favor of impervious surfaces
•	Infiltration swales
•	Detention ponds/constructed wetlands
•	Stabilization and re-vegetation of erosional features and disturbed lands
•	Properly graded, constructed, drained gas field roads and other native surfaced roads.
•	Sand filters to intercept and treat piped municipal stormwater discharges

The following stream channel/bed improvement and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration related BMPs are appropriate in the watershed:
•	Removal of inappropriate riprap (car bodies, scrap metal, scrap concrete, etc.)

For agricultural BMPs, NRCS can provide design and engineering assistance for property owners who are not agricultural producers.  The NRCS price list will be used as the basis for cost determination for applicable BMP design.  Stormwater management BMPs, stream channel/bed improvements and wetlands/riparian habitat restoration will be designed by appropriate engineers.  Clearances and certifications (archeological, cultural and historical) and permits for stream channel work from the Army Corps of Engineers and NMED will be obtained by the engineer or the property owner/manager.     

Bacteria and nutrient load reductions for agricultural BMPs were discussed above.  Stormwater related BMPs would provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by reducing the discharge of manure and other fecal wastes, fertilizer and sediment to the rivers from storm events.  Stream channel improvements and wetlands and riparian habitat restoration will provide load reductions for bacteria, nutrients and sedimentation by restoring the natural function of the habitat, increasing assimilative capacity and reducing stream bank erosion.

...

A variety of indicators to measure success will be used depending on the type and location of the BMP implemented.  Water sampling for E. coli bacteria and/or nutrients may be used when agricultural BMPs are implemented within a sub-watershed with a perennial stream.  This type of measurement is consistent with the monitoring of the Stevens Arroyo and Shumway Arroyo watersheds being conducted under the Phase II project.  Water quality sampling will be for bacteria along the La Plata and San Juan Rivers and nutrients along the Animas River.  All projects will begin by establishing a relevant baseline(s) from historical sampling events, if available, and/or sampling events prior to implementing a BMP.  A post monitoring plan will determine a reduction in bacterial or nutrient loading.  

Appropriate pollutant load reduction models will be used for agricultural BMPs located in areas without perennial streams.  One such model is STEPL, which is a simplified spreadsheet tool for estimating the load reductions that result from implementing BMPs.  STEPL includes a management practice calculator that computes the combined effectiveness of multiple practices implemented in serial or parallel configurations (or both) in a watershed.  This model is preferred because users of the model are not required to have any specialized programming skills.  STEPL will be used for BMPs implemented in the Animas River watershed to model nutrient and sediment load reductions.

Currently there are no acceptable methods to model fecal and E. coli bacterial load reductions from BMP implementation.  Where possible, a sampling plan that includes the collection and analysis of water samples for E. coli bacteria will be developed to document pre- and post-BMP bacteria levels.  A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) will be developed and submitted for approval.  Sampling will conform to the QAPP approved as part of this project.    

Vegetative changes and recovery will be used to monitor the effectiveness of wetlands and riparian habitat restoration projects.  Visual and photographic documentation will be used for monitoring stream channel improvements.

The Upper Gila Watershed Steward Program is an education project that will enhance the Master Watershed Steward program. This will lead to the development of targeted water quality improvement projects in the impaired waters in the Upper Gila Watershed, and ultimately to the removal of these waters from the 303(d) list.

Objectives
The goal is to educate and recruit people that can expand and improve the capability and competence of the Gila Watershed Partnership, and develop targeted grant projects that will lead to reductions in our impaired waters.  These projects need to be coordinated and that will be accomplished in conjunction with a Watershed Implementation Plan prepared in collaboration between the GWP and NEMO.

Methods
	This project will target the Upper Gila Watershed. This will include landowners and other stakeholders such as local companies, organizations, etc.  In particular, we will be targeting individuals from the local governmental entities that have jurisdiction in the areas of impairment. This will include the county supervisors, city and town managers, health department directors, highway department managers, etc., as well as Eastern Arizona Community College students. We believe that the students are important,  as many of these students have parents who are stakeholders in the areas with impaired waters, and the students will go on to become landowners and policymakers as well.","N","Project Implementation","15040003","150400030501","N","07/01/2008","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:34960"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,35550

The goal is to purchase two (2) no-till grain drills for use throughout Lafayette and St. Martin Parishes. 

Objectives
The objectives are to reduce soil erosion, reduce fertilizer and pesticide runoff and improve water quality in areas that are affected by the livestock industry. The use of these no-till grain drills will allow producers to directly seed their pasture sod without tilling the landscape. This Best Management Practice (Conservation Tillage) would lower the annual soil erosion rate and reduce runoff of fertilizer and pesticides from local streams, while improving water quality.  In addition, educating farmers of the environmental sustainability of this practice is a long term benefit.

The lower portion of Potato Creek was placed on the 1998 303(d) list as impaired due to fecal coliform.  In 2002, this reach was removed from the list and replaced by the middle portion of Potato Creek, again as impaired due to fecal coliform.  The EPA established a TMDL for fecal coliform in Potato Creek in 1998.  A TMDL Implementation Plan was formulated by the McIntosh Trail Regional Development Center, (RDC) in 2001 as part of the state-wide effort by the RDCs to produce implementation plans for all TMDLs.  In an effort to development a more cost-effective field application of tracking fecal coliform sources, the RDC applied for a 319 grant in 2003. A partnership with the University of Georgia, (UGA) was developed in this project with UGA providing research quality investigation into the sources of fecal coliform in the Potato Creek Watershed.  One result of the previous 319 Grant has been to develop the cost-effective field application using a combination of targeted water quality sampling and fluorometry.



Objectives
The object of this project is to reduce fecal coliform inputs into the waters of the Potato Creek Watershed.  In particular, those areas identified by the revised TMDL Implementation Plan facilitated by a previous 319 Grant, the Grandview Tributary, the Meansville Reach, and the Thomaston Reach, are targeted by the Plan as primary sources of fecal coliform.  

Methods
There are three distinct activities associated with this project:
1.	Implement grazing management BMPs in the Meansville Reach.  Other locations will also be identified for potential implantation efforts.
2.	Implement a waste control system at the Thomaston kennel.
3.	Implement pet waste disposal stations in the Grandview Tributary section.

"349","items",NA,"CO",103394,"Tools to Address Agricultural Nutrient Nonpoint Source Contamination","$80,138","Overview
This project will create two resources that will contribute guidance and centralization to the problem of agricultural nutrient nonpoint source pollution in Colorado. First, the project will build a comprehensive decision support tool that guides a user faced with potential nutrient management issues through the process of problem description to BMP recommendation. The basis of this tool will be a clearinghouse of nutrient BMPs described by published literature that addresses methods of controlling nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nonpoint source agricultural contamination. Coupled with field and watershed characteristics provided as user input, this tool will direct the user to potential BMPs, along with their estimated cost of implementation, maintenance requirements and background research. Users will have the option of interfacing with the clearinghouse through a participatory geographic information system (GIS) that operates on a web platform to further investigate site-specific suitability of selected BMPs to maximize economic effectiveness. This web platform will be integrated with the Environmental Risk Assessment and Management System (eRAMs) under development at Colorado State University (CSU). The publically available eRAMS technology facilitates the assessment, siting and implementation of conservation practices to reduce sediment, nutrient and pesticide losses. Since it is a web-based platform, it does not require the user to upload additional software with associated updates and fees. 

Concurrently, to gain user and stakeholder acceptance of the BMPs catalogued under the nutrient BMP clearinghouse, a special advisory task force will be convened to provide input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality as well as advise the development of the GIS integrated BMP tool. This task force will be modeled after the successful groundwater BMP advisory committee that currently serves the Agricultural Chemicals and Groundwater Protection Program authorized by the Colorado Department of Agriculture. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the duration of the project. 


Objectives
Objective 1: Improve the access, reliability and understanding of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices. 

Objective 2: Enable users of the nutrient management clearinghouse to assess the suitability, economic feasibility and practicality of BMPs using a site-specific, user friendly GIS platform.

Objective 3: Identify nutrient practices, tools and procedures that do not currently have a sufficient research base to support their recommendation and adoption for conditions in Colorado.
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.




Methods
Objective 1
Task 1 – Nutrient BMP Clearinghouse: Researchers at Colorado State University will develop a clearinghouse of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that have peer-reviewed supporting research for irrigated agriculture in the Western U.S. This clearinghouse will only include BMPs that are supported by published data and literature to reduce losses of nutrient to surface and groundwater. This web-served database will be searchable by multiple factors affecting nutrient origin and transport, such as the cropping system, irrigation system and management, and soil type. The cost of implementation will be included, where available, and effectiveness per unit of nutrient removed. Most importantly, the clearinghouse will focus on BMPs appropriate to and researched in irrigated agricultural systems similar to Colorado. The clearinghouse will also include a section that provides currently available tools for nutrient management in Colorado, including fertility recommendations, calculators, software and other resources to improve nutrient use efficiency and prevent movement in irrigated agricultural systems.  

Objective 1
Task 2 – Nutrient BMP Task Force: Convene an agricultural nutrient BMP task force to review and define appropriate existing nutrient BMPs for the clearinghouse. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the project length and give input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality.
Objective 2
Task 3 products: An online, integrated toolbox of nutrient management practices and tools that allows users to assess the benefits, costs and effectiveness of nutrient BMP at the field and watershed scale. Create outreach publications, user manual, help pages and assessment mechanisms. Outcome measurements of Task 3 will involve online user online feedback and website statistics.
Objective 3
Task 4 – Identify Research Gaps: In the third phase of this project, we will use data and knowledge gaps identified in Task 1 to identify potential nutrient BMPs that have not been sufficiently tested for effectiveness and practicality under irrigated agricultural conditions similar to Colorado. 
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.

Task 5-Project Administration: Manage the project transparently and openly, providing regular updates to partners and funder. Provide progress, semi-annual, and final reports as laid out in the grant agreement. Manage project financially using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and following grant requirements. Complete draw down requests monthly. Project staff will seek review and approval on language within outreach materials before they are finalized.

"351","items",NA,"AZ",34961,"Stormwater Pollution Prevention in YOUR Neighborhood","$4,998","Overview
An important element of a successful Stormwater Program is to enhance public awareness and understanding of Stormwater Pollution Prevention issues which includes non-point source contamination.  This is accomplished through a dedicated education plan.  Our grant project is to develop a stormwater pollution prevention education program for Peoria students in grades K -8.  The education program will be titled “Stormwater Pollution Prevention in Your Neighborhood.”  The focus of the program is a hands-on, interactive stormwater model that allows the students to see the effects of non-point contaminants. The goal of the program is to educate the students on stormwater pollution prevention issues and identify positive behaviors that will enhance our environment on a long term basis.

The primary target for the project is school-age children, but it is anticipated that this message will be carried on from the children to our secondary target – the children’s families, via discussion and inspiring literature that the children will take home from the program. The success of this delivery method has been proven through other environmental education programs such as water conservation and recycling. 


Objectives
The goal of the program is to educate the students on stormwater pollution prevention issues and identify positive behaviors that will enhance our environment on a long term basis.

Methods

Two stormwater pollution prevention hands-on/interactive presentations will be developed; one for children in grades K-3 and another for grades 4-8. The presentation will be tailored to the cognitive development of each age group.     

The Stormwater Team will offer this education program to local public and charter schools.  The Stormwater School Program will also be presented at the City of Peoria Recreation Department’s before and after school program and summer recreation programs that are heavily attended by Peoria’s school age children.  Class sizes typically range from fifteen to fifty participants in each group.  The Stormwater Team anticipates conducting approximately twenty six presentations per year; therefore the anticipated audience may be up to 1,000 participants or more in one year! 

The Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program will also be promoted on our City’s website, at city sponsored events and through our Communication and Public Affairs Department.  This would be the first time the City has launched an education program dedicated solely to Stormwater Pollution Prevention. 

The “Stormwater Pollution Prevention In Your Neighborhood” Program will include the following four components.

A.  Discussion about stormwater pollution prevention:  An introduction about stormwater issues, how it affects us in Peoria and what we can do to protect our City and natural resources. This will include visual aids such as PowerPoint or poster board pictures of various sources of stormwater pollution and of the rivers, streams and lakes in Peoria that may be impacted by pollution and pollution prevention.

B.  City stormwater model:   A hands-on, interactive stormwater model will be the feature attraction of our presentation. We will use a reusable city-scape (Stormwater Model Description is listed below) staged with non-point pollution sources that the children have seen in their neighborhoods.  Examples such as car washing, pool draining, vehicles leaking and uncollected pet wastes will be visible in the model. The children will be invited to gather around the model, and point out the potential pollutants on the “city streets.”  The students will be able to identify pollutants such as a car leaking oil, a dog doing his “business” and a homeowner washing a car in the driveway.   Other items may also be added or modified at times.  The children will then use a watering can to simulate rain by sprinkling water over the scene from a plastic watering can.  The “rain” will liquefy the gels and cause “contaminated” water to run from the street to the storm drain. The spilled oil (black food coloring gel), the pet waste (brown food coloring gel) and the car wash waste (red, blue, yellow and green food coloring gel) will be washed down to level 2, via the depicted storm drains in the display, and finally to level 3, a body of clean Peoria water with miniature aquatic life represented.  This entire process will be viewed by the children through the clear acrylic layers that will comprise the model. 

City-Scape Stormwater Model Description:
The city-scape demonstration model will be constructed by stacking three acrylic boxes into one cut-out view of a neighborhood, its subterranean network of storm drains and finally, the waters that the drains spill into.  

All labor including art work, construction, assembly, administration and presentation of the lesson will be performed by City personnel and/or by utilizing voluntary services to the fullest extent possible.

"352","items",NA,"MN",101877,"Pomme de Terre  WRAPS BMP Implementation Project  ","$285,000","Overview
The Pomme de Terre River Watershed is located in west-central Minnesota and is the northern-most tributary to the Minnesota River. The Pomme de Terre River Watershed covers nearly 560,000 acres of land area (approximately 875 square miles). It is nearly equally sub-divided in ecoregions, with the northern portion of the watershed in the North Central Hardwood Forest, and the south (below Barrett Lake) in the Northern Glaciated Plains. The watershed covers portions of six counties (Big Stone, Douglas, Grant, Otter Tail, Stevens, and Swift.) 
Many differences in land form and land-use exist between the northern portions of the watershed and southern, with the former comprised of rolling hills, woodlots, and numerous glacially formed lakes. In the southern portion of the watershed, the lakes begin to diminish in favor of larger land parcels and more agricultural activity. The southern portion of the watershed also contains the largest city, Morris, with a population of just over 5000 citizens and home to a satellite University of Minnesota campus. 
The Pomme de Terre River and associated lakes are listed on the 303(d) impaired waters list for numerous impairments that include turbidity, excess nutrients, and biology (Table 1). With just under 750 total miles of rivers, streams, tributaries, and numerous lakes, the risk of impairment is fairly high. This project seeks to address multiple phosphorus and sediment loading problems addressed within the Watershed Restoration and Protections Strategy (WRAPS) and Implementation Plan. The Pomme de Terre River Association has undertaken and finished the Intensive Watershed Monitoring and planning phase of the WRAPS process and is in the implementation phase.  This project will continue the BMP implementation process for the Pomme de Terre Watershed. In addition to implementation activities, numerous opportunities exist to reach landowners and citizens of the watershed. These opportunities will be leveraged through this project and will extend the association’s current outreach program.
 
(Table 1)  A list of current impairments within the Pomme de Terre Watershed
Numerous projects have been completed in the Pomme de Terre River Watershed over the previous 6 years including a bacteria based 319 grant to reduce fecal coliform levels, turbidity TMDL and implementation plan, and most recently the Pomme de Terre River Association has completed the watershed monitoring and assessment for the MPCA Watershed Approach. Other efforts include a Surface Water Assessment Grant (SWAG) and five Clean Water Fund grants administered through BWSR to implement projects on the ground, accounting for over $1 million in implementation efforts.


Objectives
Goal:  The Pomme de Terre WRAPS BMP Implementation Project has two major goals: 1. Continue our implementation of restorative BMPs to reduce nutrient and sediment loading and to help improve habitat and biological diversity. The end goal of this grant is to reduce phosphorous loading by 1304.86 lbs/yr and sediment loading by 1304 tons/yr throughout the watershed 2. Continue to engage citizens of all ages throughout the watershed by assisting local schools, lake associations, farm groups, and residents with water education and outreach.
Objective 1:  BMP Implementation

Task A:  Creation of BMP Priority Ranking Sheet 
To further identify and insure that quality projects are being installed in critical areas the Pomme de Terre River Association, through the TAC, will be integrating a BMP ranking sheet. Project importance will no longer be determined wholly on location of the proposed BMP in relation to the highest pollution reduction need areas (WRAPS Report Table 6. Pgs. 15-17) Project ranking will also be determined by BMP type (exp. a water and sediment control basin will rank higher than a rain garden), project distance to surface water, project pollution reduction estimate (phosphorous and sediment), and practice enhancement points (points for practices previously installed and maintained or will be installed by the landowner within the same minor watershed that enhances the practice being applied for). Proposed projects located within areas of greatest pollution reduction needs will be the first factor used when determining prioritization. Prioritizing funding allocations based on these criteria will insure that we are implementing the most critical projects through voluntary implementation.
Responsible Party:  JPB Project Coordinator, Technical Advisory Committee 

Task B:  BMP Installation 
Best Management Practices will be implemented through technical assistance and project development within the Pomme de Terre Watershed with support from the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). BMPs that will be utilized our outlined in the Pomme de Terre River Major Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategies and Implementation Plan http://www.pdtriver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PdT_Major-Watershed-Plan.pdf. The TAC will contact landowners to generate program participation and oversee BMP installation. Pomme de Terre staff will conduct budget oversight, reporting and tracking of the BMP’s.  Cost share for the landowners to install BMP practices will be limited to 75% of the BMP project total cost. Project priority will be given to areas with the highest pollution reduction needs using strategies listed in the Pomme de Terre WRAPS report Table 6 pg 15-17 and by utilizing the Priority Ranking Sheet created in Task A.

Sebago Lake is a 30,513-acre lake, the second largest lake in Maine, and is located in the Towns of Sebago, Naples, Casco, Raymond, Standish and Windham.  The lake has a direct watershed of 171 square miles, a total watershed of 361 square miles and is part of the larger Casco Bay Watershed.  It has a maximum depth of 316 feet, an average depth of 107 feet and a flushing rate of 5.1 years.  
Eighty six percent of the total watershed is undeveloped, vegetated land including forests and fallow fields.  Approximately 9.3 percent is developed including residential (7 %), commercial, institutional/ public, industrial, landfills, outdoor recreation and open urban land uses.  About 30% of the residentially developed land in the total watershed area is within one-half mile of Sebago Lake.  Timber operations cover 2.5 percent of the total watershed.  Most of the logging occurs in the northern two-thirds of the watershed, remote from the lake and water supply intakes.  Agriculture uses total 2.2 % and much of this is hayfield and fallow lands.  Less than 1% is in utility use and less than 1% is gravel pits.

Sebago Lake is the primary drinking water supply for 200,000 people in 11 communities.   Since its inception in 1908, Portland Water District has been actively monitoring and working to protect Sebago Lake.   Portland Water District (PWD) owns approximately 2,500 acres of conservation land around the lower bay.  PWD maintains a 3,000-foot limit no trespassing zone and a two-mile limit no bodily contact zone to ensure the safety of the drinking water supply.  In 1993, PWD was granted a waiver to the filtration requirements of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act due in part to the purity of the water and the effectiveness of watershed protection efforts.  This waiver agreement requires ongoing monitoring of lake water quality.  PWD maintains more than 10 monitoring and surveillance programs around the lake and throughout its watershed. 

Portland Water District expends $210,000 annually on an extensive source protection program that includes education and enforcement components that focus on the highest priority areas for lake watershed protection – the activities that occur closest to the lake, itself.  PWD works in partnership with Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) and the watershed municipalities to complete Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA) permit by rule, Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) and shoreland zone inspections.  PWD also completes development plan reviews, septic system inspections and permitting, watershed property consultations, awards lake steward cost sharing grants to address erosion issues, and runs a successful school-based education program that is offered to all watershed schools. In 1999, PWD received a 319 grant for the Kettle Cove area of Sebago Lake. The project identified fifty-three potential BMP implementation sites.  PWD completed forty-three Watershed Property Consultation (WPC) reports, assisted in the construction of BMPs on nineteen sites in the Kettle Cove subwatershed, and provided over $23,000 in matching BMP implementation funds to private landowners.

Portland Water District has monitored Sebago Lake’s water quality since 1976.  Monitoring occurs monthly from ice out until fall turnover and includes deep basin stations in Big Bay, Jordan Bay and Lower Bay.  Recent data (since 1990) show a significant decline in Secchi disk transparency and an increase in chlorophyll a and total phosphorous levels in all three deep basins.  Personal communication with MDEP sites a recent downward trend in water quality.


Objectives
The primary purpose of this project is to significantly reduce erosion and export of sediment and phosphorus into Sebago Lake.  Conservation practices that reduce erosion and polluted runoff will be installed at 12 road sites for an estimated annual reduction of 68 tons of sediment (48 pounds of phosphorus); twenty watershed property consultations will be completed to provide landowners with technical assistance to address existing erosion sites; and an estimated 476 hours (60 workdays) will be spent inspecting construction sites  to ensure proper installation and use of erosion controls (Shoreland Zoning Act and Natural Resource Protection Act permit by rule) in Sebago and Naples.

Methods
The Sebago Lake Conservation Project – Phase I will be sponsored by the Portland Water District and coordinated by the Cumberland County Soil & Water Conservation District.  Local partners include the Cumberland County Soil & Water Conservation District (CCSWCD), Portland Water District (PWD), the Towns of Sebago and Naples, Camp O-AT-KA, Camp Mataponi and the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.  

Through this project, the CCSWCD and PWD staff, watershed volunteers from the northwest side of the lake, and the Towns of Sebago and Naples will coordinate and install conservation practices at 12 private and public road sites to reduce an estimated 68 tons of soil (48 pounds of phosphorus) per year from entering Sebago Lake.  

PWD will continue to work in partnership with MDEP and the watershed Towns of Sebago and Naples to complete ESC, NRPA and shoreland zone inspections.  CCSWCD will work through PWD’s biannual Lakekeepers Roundtable meetings to facilitate a discussion and determine action strategies regarding the implementation of the State Erosion and Sediment Control Law as it pertains to gravel roads and egregious erosion sites.  
CCSWCD staff will work with PWD to determine the barriers and incentives for taking advantage of PWD Watershed Property Consultations and Lake Stewards grants.  Information gleaned from this analysis will be applied to the programs to ensure greater participation by targeted hotspot neighborhoods. 
PWD staff will continue to offer Watershed Property Consultations (WPC) to watershed landowners, municipalities and road associations.  Twenty WPCs will be provided and site conditions and BMPs will be summarized in brief reports.  
Project activities will be showcased in presentations at the Portland Water District and Town Board Meetings, which will include before and after slides of the road sites.  An initial newsletter announcement will be developed and showcased in the Portland Water District “Watershed News” that is distributed to landowners and businesses around Sebago Lake.

"354","items",NA,"CO",103394,"Tools to Address Agricultural Nutrient Nonpoint Source Contamination","$80,138","Overview
This project will create two resources that will contribute guidance and centralization to the problem of agricultural nutrient nonpoint source pollution in Colorado. First, the project will build a comprehensive decision support tool that guides a user faced with potential nutrient management issues through the process of problem description to BMP recommendation. The basis of this tool will be a clearinghouse of nutrient BMPs described by published literature that addresses methods of controlling nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nonpoint source agricultural contamination. Coupled with field and watershed characteristics provided as user input, this tool will direct the user to potential BMPs, along with their estimated cost of implementation, maintenance requirements and background research. Users will have the option of interfacing with the clearinghouse through a participatory geographic information system (GIS) that operates on a web platform to further investigate site-specific suitability of selected BMPs to maximize economic effectiveness. This web platform will be integrated with the Environmental Risk Assessment and Management System (eRAMs) under development at Colorado State University (CSU). The publically available eRAMS technology facilitates the assessment, siting and implementation of conservation practices to reduce sediment, nutrient and pesticide losses. Since it is a web-based platform, it does not require the user to upload additional software with associated updates and fees. 

Concurrently, to gain user and stakeholder acceptance of the BMPs catalogued under the nutrient BMP clearinghouse, a special advisory task force will be convened to provide input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality as well as advise the development of the GIS integrated BMP tool. This task force will be modeled after the successful groundwater BMP advisory committee that currently serves the Agricultural Chemicals and Groundwater Protection Program authorized by the Colorado Department of Agriculture. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the duration of the project. 


Objectives
Objective 1: Improve the access, reliability and understanding of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices. 

Objective 2: Enable users of the nutrient management clearinghouse to assess the suitability, economic feasibility and practicality of BMPs using a site-specific, user friendly GIS platform.

Objective 3: Identify nutrient practices, tools and procedures that do not currently have a sufficient research base to support their recommendation and adoption for conditions in Colorado.
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.




Methods
Objective 1
Task 1 – Nutrient BMP Clearinghouse: Researchers at Colorado State University will develop a clearinghouse of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that have peer-reviewed supporting research for irrigated agriculture in the Western U.S. This clearinghouse will only include BMPs that are supported by published data and literature to reduce losses of nutrient to surface and groundwater. This web-served database will be searchable by multiple factors affecting nutrient origin and transport, such as the cropping system, irrigation system and management, and soil type. The cost of implementation will be included, where available, and effectiveness per unit of nutrient removed. Most importantly, the clearinghouse will focus on BMPs appropriate to and researched in irrigated agricultural systems similar to Colorado. The clearinghouse will also include a section that provides currently available tools for nutrient management in Colorado, including fertility recommendations, calculators, software and other resources to improve nutrient use efficiency and prevent movement in irrigated agricultural systems.  

Objective 1
Task 2 – Nutrient BMP Task Force: Convene an agricultural nutrient BMP task force to review and define appropriate existing nutrient BMPs for the clearinghouse. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the project length and give input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality.
Objective 2
Task 3 products: An online, integrated toolbox of nutrient management practices and tools that allows users to assess the benefits, costs and effectiveness of nutrient BMP at the field and watershed scale. Create outreach publications, user manual, help pages and assessment mechanisms. Outcome measurements of Task 3 will involve online user online feedback and website statistics.
Objective 3
Task 4 – Identify Research Gaps: In the third phase of this project, we will use data and knowledge gaps identified in Task 1 to identify potential nutrient BMPs that have not been sufficiently tested for effectiveness and practicality under irrigated agricultural conditions similar to Colorado. 
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.

Task 5-Project Administration: Manage the project transparently and openly, providing regular updates to partners and funder. Provide progress, semi-annual, and final reports as laid out in the grant agreement. Manage project financially using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and following grant requirements. Complete draw down requests monthly. Project staff will seek review and approval on language within outreach materials before they are finalized.

"355","items",NA,"GA",26128,"Implementing Agricultural Components of TMDL Implementation Plans in the Upper Broad River Basin","$493,280","Overview
The Broad River Watershed (northern portion of HUC 3060104) is located in the Savannah River Basin.  This watershed comprises an estimated 167,270 agricultural acres in Northeast Georgia’s Banks, Franklin, Habersham, Jackson, Madison and Stephens counties.  In addition, a small portion of Habersham County falls within this watershed.  A map of the project area has been provided as Attachment B.

Within the Upper Broad River Watershed, the State of Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD) has determined and developed Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Implementation Plans for several streams including:

Stream Name	Status of Use	Violation
Bear Creek	Not Supporting for Fishing	DO
Hudson River	Not Supporting for Fishing	FC
Middle Fork Broad River	Not Supporting for Fishing	FC
North Fork Broad River	Not Supporting for Fishing 	FC
Crawford Creek	Poor Habitat	Biota, Sediment
Little Crawford Creek	Poor Habitat	Biota, Sediment
Shoal Creek	Poor Habitat	Biota, Sediment

These streams compromise an estimated 46 miles of impaired streams either partially supporting or not supporting their designated purposes.  For each of these streams, agriculture has been identified as a definite or likely source of fecal coliform or sediment.  One of the last free-flowing rivers in Georgia, the Broad River provides drinking water to several towns, and is utilized for industrial and agricultural water supply and offers an abundance of recreation activities.  

Agriculture can be a significant source of nutrients, which result in excess or nuisance growth of aquatic plants and depletion of dissolved oxygen.  GAEPD has stated that sources of oxygen demanding substances may include the diffuse runoff of agricultural fertilizer and animal waste from manure applications, grazing animals, soil erosion (sediment transport), and runoff from animal operations.  The nutrients of most concern from agricultural land uses are nitrogen and phosphorus, which can result from commercial fertilizer or animal wasteland applications.  In addition to contributing to nutrient loads, animal waste may contribute high loads of bacteria and microbial pathogens.  Nutrients, bacteria and pathogens may reach waters through direct runoff as solids or in their soluble form.

The TMDL Implementation Plan has identified nonpoint sources as the primary cause of excessive pollutant loading.  The plan advocates the installation of BMPs to address the major pollutant categories of concern for the watershed.  The Upper Broad River Watershed TMDL Implementation Project will provide opportunities for the planning and installation of BMPs that meet EPD requirements and may supply some of the data necessary for any revision of the Georgia TMDL Implementation Plan.  

Agriculture is a strong industry within this subbasin, particularly the poultry industry.  Traditionally, agricultural conservation and water quality restoration programs have been under funded and failed to be of assistance in addressing nonpoint source pollution.  Even with slight increases in Farm Bill funding support of programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP), funding does not meet the demand of the agricultural community to effectively control fecal coliform and impairments leading to dissolved oxygen problems.  In 2005, USDA-NRCS was unable to fund 87 applicants requesting more than $1.4 million dollars in federal assistance through the EQIP program application process.  The proposed Upper Broad River TMDL Implementation Project is a part of a continuing and multi-phased effort attempting to respond to watershed TMDLs by implementing agricultural BMPs to restore, abate, and improve water quality in watershed streams and reservoirs used for aquatic habitat and contact recreation.  The Upper Broad River Watershed TMDL Project will offer landowners other opportunities for funding to accelerate the installation of BMPs that address animal waste, nutrients, and soil erosion in the watershed.  

The Chestatee-Chattahoochee RC&D Council has an ongoing project, the North Fork Broad River 319(h) Project.  This project is exclusive to the North Fork Broad River Watershed in Franklin and Stephens Counties.  The focus of this project has been soil erosion BMP installation and prevention.  The installation of stream revetments has been the predominant practice within the North Fork Broad River 319(h) Project with some exclusion fencing, critical area treatment and stream crossings also being installed.  In addition, this project also targets a limited number of unpaved (dirt) roads to reduce soil erosion and sediment transport.  The North Fork Broad River 319(h) Project does not address animal waste issues, and the total number of participants has been somewhat limited by the substantial cost of stream revetments.  The proposed Upper Broad River Watershed Project will compliment this and other existing programs by continuing to offer cost share funding for soil erosion BMP installation and by offering additional funding for the implementation of BMPs that address animal waste issues within a larger portion of the Broad River Watershed.


Objectives
The objective of this Section 319(h) project and its companion projects is to get approximately 60 percent of the agricultural chemical and nutrient application and animal loading and grazing areas covered by the project activities (BMP contracts and educational components) over an estimated project time of three years.  These activities will contribute to the prevention, control and/or abatement of much of the nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides used in agricultural production from reaching the waterways and will significantly reduce sediment, fecal coliform, and will improve dissolved oxygen in the long-term.  Over the years, these pollutant loadings will be brought to a level that approaches water quality standards thus supporting implementation of Savannah River Basin TMDL Implementation Plans.  Targeting and prioritizing agricultural areas in the watershed will accomplish this.  BMPs will be selected and installed based upon potential effectiveness of the BMP to reduce pollutant load reductions.  

Methods
There are an estimated 2,185 farms in the watershed with a majority being beef cattle or poultry operations.  Of the estimated 2,185 farms in this subbasin, experience and existing records indicate approximately 50 percent (1,093) will neither need nor apply for assistance.  Those farming operations requiring a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES) are not eligible to participate in Section 319(h) projects under existing USEPA rules.  Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) eligible for Section 319(h) financial assistance must have and be working towards implementing a Nutrient Management Plan to include the following USEPA requirements:

§	Provide and maintain buffers or equivalent practices
§	Divert clean water
§	Prevent direct contact of confined animals within waters of the United States
§	Address animal mortality
§	Address chemical disposal
§	Address proper operation and maintenance
§	Address record keeping and testing
§	Maintain proper storage capacity
§	Address rates and timing of land applications of manure and wastewater

Within the included counties, there are approximately 3,100 broiler houses, 480 layer houses, and one dairy.  There are nearly 73,000 head of beef cattle being raised within the included counties as well as 10,000 goats, 3,000 horses, 1,200 sheep and an estimated 3,000 swine.  The goal of the agricultural component of this Section 319(h) project is to contract with 20-30 landowners or operators over the life of the project.  To treat and protect the watershed, there are 65 to 84 potential BMPs listed with Standards and Specifications in the USDA-NRCS Technical Guide, Section IV that may be used.  Most will be incorporated as groups or systems of practices to obtain the greatest pollution reduction and fit the farm management scheme.  A Nutrient Management Plan will be a significant component of most contracts.  BMP costs will be based on the current USDA- EQIP cost list.  Landowner cost share rates will generally be 60 percent federal funding for qualified practices.  The project steering committee in conjunction with GAEPD will establish project guidelines, which includes cost share rates and maximum project costs per landowner contract within the scope of the Section 319(h) requirements and the approved project budget.  The steering committee will also be responsible for determining which selecting targeting areas and prioritize applicants based upon project effectiveness to address pollutant loading.  The target audience is generally the watershed landowners, specifically those with livestock, poultry, and row crops.  The farming community, local officials, and the general public will be kept informed of the water quality improvement efforts taking place by project activities through a news release announcing the project, a brochure defining project activities, project updates through local media new releases, and through two tours and/or field days.  A Project Coordinator will develop an estimated 30-40 landowner/operator project contracts, and work with the NRCS to install BMPs or systems of BMPs throughout the watershed.  Site selections will be based upon the potential effectiveness of the BMP to impact an impaired stream and the BMP’s potential to affect the pollutant of concern for that stream.

The MNNRD understands the importance of monitoring and therefore will greatly expand nitrate and (total coliform) bacteria analysis for all domestic users and expand monitoring of other wells.  This project will collect a significant amount of information to determine the extent, nature and causes of point and nonpoint contamination in the district.  The end goal of the project is to develop long-term consistent and comparable data and information on district wide groundwater quality conditions to support sound management and policy decisions.  In achieving this goal, residents of the district will also be educated on the groundwater quality conditions and this should initiate a grassroots effort at protecting and enhancing groundwater.  If during the process, unacceptable groundwater conditions are detected from the monitoring, early management steps can be taken to resolve issues.  By the end of the project, a stable and consistent monitoring network will be created that produces a good base of information that can be provided to other agencies and patrons of the district.

Objectives
1.	Collect and analyze samples from at least 25% of all active registered domestic wells and irrigation wells within the MNNRD for nitrates.
2.	Collect and analyze samples from at least 25%of all active registered livestock wells within the MNNRD for nitrates.
3.	Analyze any sample requested by a resident of the district.
a.	Analyze for both nitrates and total coliform bacteria
b.	Utilize multi-media approach (press releases, MNNRD newsletter, extension and other partner’s newsletters, local radio) to announce the service. 
c.	Develop a brochure to distribute that: describes the analytical services and how residents can participate, provides a general explanation of the results and pollution prevention tips. Distribution will be via the NRD’s web site and other venues such as trade shows, etc.
d.	Prepare and distribute news releases after significant events (floods, power outages) that potentially impact residential wells to serve as reminders of the analytical service.
4.	Annually produce a map of the NRD that shows the wells tested and the results obtained.  A large copy of the map would be maintained at the NRD offices with smaller versions being included in district newsletters.
5.	Utilize the data and information to update and modify the monitoring strategy.
6.	Determine from the data and information gained the need to develop and implement any immediate or future ground water quality action plans.
7.	Use the data and information to assist in the implementation of Best Management Practices throughout the district.
8.	Develop a Quality Assurance/Quality Control program for water sampling and analysis to cover activities described above, including Standard Operating Procedures for all activities.  Document will be submitted to NDEQ of review and approval.
9.	Begin preliminary steps with the Wellhead Protection Program for three communities in the district that have municipal wells. 
a.	Contact appropriate individuals and begin the communication process to determine the current status in regards to wellhead protection
b.	Coordinate the submittal of one completed wellhead protection and management plan.



Methods
Specifically, the MNNRD would like to obtain a bench top spectrophotometer and supplies to conduct nitrate and other parameter analysis in-house versus shipping 100% of the samples to a contract laboratory.  For quality control/quality assurance purposes, contract laboratory analysis will still be utilized for statewide groundwater monitoring network samples.","N","Project Implementation","10150004","101500041203","N","10/01/2011","Accepted by EPA","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:79120"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,5000

 This project would focus its efforts in the latest road side ditch stabilization efforts. It would utilize a combination of techniques from hard to soft practices. Demonstrations utilizing check dams, rip rap, erosion control fabric, as well as infiltration techniques would be performed on a minimum of 20,000' of road ditch in the two county area. A minimum of 50% of this work will occur within MS4 communities. A minimum of 85% of this work will take place in either a threatened or impaired watershed as listed on the NYS DEC Priority Water body List. Over 50% of this work will occur within a designated TMDL watershed or waters that flow directly to a TMDL water body. Over 50% of this work will take place within the recharge areas for public drinking water sources. This project will save a minimum of 3,703 tons of sediment annually. This will result in a savings of nearly 4,000lbs of Phosphorous a year, and nearly 7,500lbs of Nitrogen a year. Both Sediments and Nutrients are listed as the main impairment of all the PWL and TMDL watersheds impacted by this proposal. These projects will focus on severely eroded sites only with high velocity high impacts. This means existing velocities of over 3.6 ft/sec, which result in the inability to maintain any vegetation. 

Objectives
This is a shovel ready project. Both Soil and Water Conservation Districts have engineers on staff. Both Soil and Water Conservation Districts share equipment and equipment operators jointly. This allows for personnel and equipment to be moved not only throughout a county but regionally to make every project we do as cost effective as possible. The large storm events and flooding we have had the last several years have crossed municipal and watershed boundaries. That is why this grant focuses on an all encompassing approach for the two county area. Many of these projects have been assessed and documented after the major storm events that we have had. This project again would also allow us to use the knowledge gained in these storm events to work in non impacted areas to protect against the same kind of failures when storm events hit those areas. We can begin work immediately on this proposal. We have the support of our municipalities our water quality coordinating committee's, Cornell University, and our local residents. This project would directly impact goals of our local water quality strategy, as well specific water body strategies such as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL and its WIP and the Great Lakes Basin Restoration Initiative

Methods
This project will utilize $220,000 of materials (rip rap, erosion control fabric, tile, etc...) , 600 excavator hours at $130 per hour, 400 loader hours at $100 per hour, 400 10 Wheeler hours at $80 an hour and 25 loads of hydro-seeding at $20,000.  We will focus not only on implementation, but education of municipal officials and highway personnel as well. We will utilize Cornell University's, Rebecca Schneider,  and the two Soil and Water Conservation Districts to put on at least one educational event and have at least two sites monitored for both sediment and nutrient load with educational signage. This will allow us to take this project beyond this grant proposal and have a significant impact regionally.

FY2004 SECTION 319 PROJECT SUMMARY – IOWA Project #14 TITLE:  Infiltration-Based Stormwater Management in Iowa’s Great Lakes Region LOCATION:  Dickinson County, Iowa BACKGROUND/OVERVIEW:  While agricultural land dominates the watershed of Iowa’s Great Lakes, urbanization is a growing source of nonpoint pollution. As urban growth and rural subdivisions within the Great Lakes area increase, there will be more impervious and compacted surfaces, which will lead to larger volumes of urban nonpoint runoff being conveyed to the lakes. Sediment from construction sites, nutrients from lawn fertilizers, grit and hydrocarbons from roads and parking lots, heavy metals, pathogens, and thermal pollution from heated impervious surface runoff are all causing water quality problems in the Iowa Great Lakes region. Frequent, low-intensity rains account for the vast majority of the annual precipitation and runoff events. Where storm water management systems are required they typically do not manage these low intensity events or the first flush from the high-intensity events. However, these low intensity events can often deliver some of the highest pollutant loads. These flows can be managed with on-site infiltration-based BMPs, which this project will demonstrate. This project will demonstrate a number of infiltration-based BMPs focusing on stormwater management. The project will provide models for new developments and for retrofitting existing impervious landscapes that are currently contributing stormwater discharges into East and West Okoboji, Big Spirit, and Upper Gar Lakes. One of the five planned demonstration sites will be the Maritime Museum and Amusement Park, which will offer a highly visible site with potentially one million tourists visiting per year. An extensive information/education program will be conducted to promote the project’s activities. Funding is requested to support financial incentives for BMP installation, the I/E activities and the water quality monitoring project.

Project #19


TITLE:  Assessment and Management Plan for the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed

LOCATION:  Dickenson County, Iowa

BACKGROUND/OVERVIEW:  The Iowa Great Lakes Watershed is a 90,000 acre watershed located on the border of Iowa and Minnesota, with approximately 2/3 of the watershed in Dickenson County, Iowa and 1/3 in Jackson County, Minnesota.  The chain of lakes is of great natural and economic importance to the State of Iowa.  The Iowa Great Lakes draw over 1 million visitors each year and generates over $130 million annually in tourism.  Two of the lakes are drinking water sources for several local communities and the lakes are of significant recreational value for fishing, swimming, boating, etc.

Beginning in 2002, a project was initiated by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in cooperation with the Dickinson SWCD to consolidate Geographical Information System data for the watershed and identify missing data layers needed for a watershed assessment.  Significant progress has been made over the past years and project efforts are continuing.  Critical data is being gathered and consolidated with existing data layers.  Various organizations have been involved in gathering data and verifying existing data quality.  A significant attempt has also been made to keep stakeholders involved and informed of project status and milestones.  Current assessment information is available, maintained and being continuously updated, but has yet to be incorporated into a management plan.

This project will complete the assessment for the Iowa Great Lakes watershed that identifies all urban and rural point and nonpoint pollution sources that may impact water quality.  The assessment will also determine the potential risk of these water impairment sources related to their impact on water quality.  In addition, the project will develop a comprehensive watershed management plan based on the results of the watershed assessment that can be used by federal, state and local partners to focus conservation practice implementation efforts on targeted areas within the standard for water quality in the Iowa Great Lakes watershed.  Both these documents can then be used as a guide to protect water resources from urban and agricultural point and nonpoint sources of pollution, promote sound urban and rural community development, and enhance fish and wildlife habitat ecosystems in an environmentally friendly manner that does not compromise the integrity or livelihood of agricultural producers within the watershed.

Funding is provided to support full-time staff and associated costs to complete the assessment and management plan.

This research includes an extensive social assessment prior to the beginning of formal collaborative efforts in the restoration and feasibility study.  All agencies and individuals with past involvement and / or future relationship with lake restoration efforts are included in this assessment, including federal, state, county, city, non-profit entities, as well as economic development organizations, organized citizen groups, watershed residents, and lake recreation users.  Social data important to this planning project includes expectations for outcome of the restoration and feasibility study, technical understanding of existing water quality conditions and potential changes necessary for successful lake restoration.  Pre and post surveys will be conducted with stakeholders, including watershed residents, to measure changes in technical understanding and beliefs.  This social data will be integrated with results of stakeholder analysis and mapping to characterize the various competing interests relative to lake restoration alternatives, their scope of influence in decision making and acceptance, and their ability to influence the ecological outcomes of restoration activities.  
Social aspects of this planning include four phases: social assessment, communication & learning about lake and stream water quality monitoring, social data integration with biophysical restoration planning, and communication of final results.  Each phase is briefly described below, including budget justification


Objectives
Phases & Schedule
(1)	Pre (early)-project social assessment:  One-on-one and small group interviews conducted with stakeholders; internet and paper survey to watershed residents (August 15 to October 31, 2007).
(2)	Communication & other learning activities with stakeholders: Web and neighborhood-based communication leading to learning about water quality conditions and landscape impacts.  Compilation and analysis of press coverage.  (October 1, 2007 – May 31, 2009).
(3)	Social data integration with biophysical data: includes gis-based predictive modeling of potential stakeholder acceptance of restoration alternatives using social assessment and learning activity data, income and other social indicators, and other variables identified in the survey (December 31, 2007 – March 1, 2008).
(4)	Communication of restoration and feasibility research and findings (October 1, 2007 – May 31, 2009


Methods
	Social assessment report including: identification and role of all stakeholders in project (including scope of their influence), quantitative and qualitative data from project stakeholders included in social assessment interviews and small group meetings, including a statistically representative sample of watershed residents.  Data include: technical understanding of water quality impairment, lake and stream condition and function, a clear understanding of outcomes people desire and expect from lake restoration, limitations of acceptance of restoration practices.  
	Communication of research data and general urban lake and stream condition and function as well as water quality sampling data to stakeholders via internet, neighborhood group meetings, and stakeholder meetings.  Activities center on adult education and learning rather than simply informing people.  Templates will be useful in other similar applications. 
	GIS-based predictive modeling of potential stakeholder acceptance of restoration alternatives; social assessment data integrated with biophysical data including water quality modeling, landcover, and socio-economic data to predict both acceptance and vulnerability of restoration practices and alternatives.

"375","items",NA,"IA",52902,"Iowa Great Lakes Targeted Watershed Project","$215,862","Overview
The Iowa Great Lakes watershed is an area of about 88,167 acres (140 square miles) located in northwest Iowa and southwest Minnesota.  Approximately 76 percent of the watershed lies within Dickinson County, Iowa and the remainder within Jackson County, Minnesota.  The Iowa Great Lakes are major recreational lakes for Iowa residents and visitors from adjacent states.  Agricultural runoff containing sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides negatively affect water quality.  Urbanization contributes pollution from stormwater run-off as well as a number of private sewage disposal systems within the watershed area that are improperly installed or that are not functioning.  The Iowa Great Lakes Targeted Watershed Project is proposed for approximately 13,500 acres of the 88,167 acres (Attachment 4. page 30).  
Surface water from the lakes in Dickinson County is primarily used for public and private water supplies.   Public water supplies provide 900 million gallons per year to Dickinson County residents and visitors.  Other water usage consists of private use, and farms that accounts for 62 million gallons per year. Irrigation and mining combined account for 83 million gallons per year.
Visitors to the region increase the summer population within the county from approximately 16,424 to more than 100,000 people.  The tourist population presents challenges to dealing with public wastewater systems, and raised concerns as early as the 1930s about a need to maintain a pollution-free environment.  Currently, the Iowa Great Lakes Sanitary District consists of 95 miles of sanitary sewers, 63 pump stations, and 1 central wastewater treatment facility.  The sanitary district has expanded to include more than 23,450 acres, 11,550 acres of which are water.
Total phosphorous is considered the critical element in the IGL systems. It appears that there is a linear relationship between TP inputs and algal levels so that a halving of the TP input to a given lake might be expected to reduce the algal population by one-half.  There is, of course, a lower limit to this relationship for if all inputs were removed, there would still be phosphorous internal nutrient recycling from the sediments.  This appears, however, to be a small amount.  In years with larger surface runoff, there is higher phosphorous concentration in the streams, and the greatest input of phosphorous to the lakes and highest levels of summer algal blooms in the lakes.
Surface water runoff contributes a substantial proportion of nutrients to all of the lakes, but there is considerable annual variability in contribution from runoff depending on the amount of precipitation between dry and wet years. Lake to lake flow is a significant factor in the movement of nutrients between lakes, and sediment flux a significant factor in the movement of nutrients within individual lakes.  
As part of a phased approach, an intensive information and education program, construction of erosion control practices, and sediment control on construction sites is proposed.  These proposed practices will manage sediment runoff and nutrient runoff on agricultural and urban areas.  Sediment control “structures” such as waterways, wetlands, modified terraces, grade stabilization structures, sediment basins, and rain gardens is proposed and will be combined with nutrient and pesticide management and reduced tillage to reduce non-point source pollution.  
A reduction of 15% of the sediment and phosphorous delivered to a water body will be looked at as a success in this short-term project focused primarily at education within the project area which is also, for the most part, the top 25% sediment load producing sub-watersheds (Attachment 3, Figure 4).  In addition, four urban areas have been identified (Attachment 2) as part of this project as needing immediate assistance.  A combination of urban and agricultural conservation practices, shoreline revegetation, and education of landowners will be used to achieve these results on both the urban and the agricultural arenas.  In addition, a demonstration site that shows the connection to the Iowa Great Lakes Sanitary District and a program of septic tank inspections should be viewed as critical to the success of this project. 
The Iowa Great Lakes Project proposes to implement a 5-year project with a large education component along with urban and agricultural best management practices.  The first full year of the project will focus on educational activities along with an intense effort to re-establish vegetation on the key shorelines in, for the most part, on Lower Gar Lake.  Year 2 through 5 will include the educational component but will also include both urban and agricultural practice establishment to include the sanitary sewer connection demonstration project.  The approach to this project will be similar to the Lake Rathbun Project and its approach to targeting priority areas.  The budget request for this project will be small when compared to the matching dollars that will be leveraged against it.  The total request through the 319/WPF/WSPF programs will be $431,725 and the budget will be outlined in detail within this application.  The total anticipated project expense will be $4,323,749 
The TMDL’s for both Upper Gar Lake and Lower Gar Lake have been written and both state the water coming to them from the rest of the Iowa Great Lakes chain of lakes is the primary cause of these lakes being listed as threatened lakes.  In addition, Dr. John Downing from Iowa State University has research that clearly shows (and has stated verbally) that watershed influences have a major impact on these two lakes.  Without reducing the amount of pollutants, primarily phosphorous, coming from the rest of the Iowa Great Lakes, these lakes cannot be delisted as threatened lakes in the State of Iowa.   
The project will use an intensive water monitoring scheme to evaluate the projects accomplishments.  In addition to water monitoring, modeling programs that show the before, during, and after pollutant load reduction will be utilized to establish reduction achievement.  Models will be used on projects that do not have water monitoring associated with them.    






Objectives
Based upon the extensive watershed assessment findings, it has been determined that the following practice list would provide the most benefit for dollar expended and that would have the greatest chances for meeting the goals established for the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed.  Please refer to Attachments 2 and 3 for the priority locations where the practices will be implemented.  A brief description has been included below to illustrate specific application of some of the practices with respects to this project. That assessment has shown areas where significantly higher than normal sediment delivery to the lakes is occurring.  
Agricultural Related Practices:
Grassed Waterways
The need for this practice in crop fields was identified during the assessment in areas of concentrated flow where waterways have never been installed or the practice has been abandoned.  It is common throughout the agriculture sector to have this practice abandoned due to a slow degradation of the waterway from inadequate maintenance or where the vegetation is has been eradicated due spraying operations.  Funding for this practice will primarily utilize the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) due to lucrative incentives offered.  Local REAP allocations will also be used to fund the practice in areas that are not eligible for CRP,  livestock grazing restrictions conflicts arise, or in situations where other obstacles prevent a landowner from participating in the program.  
Due to the nature of the landform, this practice is of particular importance since the ephemeral gullies that develop in these areas of concentrated flow often result in extremely high sediment delivery rates.  Sediment that is mobilized in these areas has little chance of being captured by other BMP’s resulting in direct loads being delivered to the receiving water body.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  10,000 feet
Water and Sediment Control Basins
This practice is being suggested as an alternative in many instances where waterways may not fit into an individuals farming operation.  Some areas of concentrated flow within crop fields would require a waterway system that has significant impacts upon the row pattern of the field, which may prevent a landowner from adopting any practice at all to address the concern.  These sediment basins can and often are designed using the NRCS terrace program and are for all practical purposes simply shorter terraces.  Basins are an effective alternative to waterways, which also allows the landowner, maintain a farmable row pattern.  Since much the slope of the land is not steep enough to require extensive terrace systems, in many instances, this practice, will have higher trapping efficiencies and is well-received by landowners.  
Further enhancing the adoption of this practice, traditional intake risers will be replaced with buried intakes to enhance the trapping efficiency of the system.  A significant amount of sediment is often flushed through the traditional riser but will be trapped in an underground matrix of soil and rock without interrupting row patterns.   This concept has been widely accepted throughout the county in the past and may well be the key aspect of the practice to entice landowner participation.
In other instances the where areas of concentrated flow are delivering high loads of sediment; this practice will be utilized in the more traditional sense as a catchment to trap pollutants and slow water.  These basins will be strategically located in small drainage areas where significant loading is occurring.  Under certain circumstances when inadequate protection can be obtained, these basins will also be utilized to cleanse runoff before reaching open water.
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  12 basins
Grade Stabilization Structures 
Classic gullies have been identified throughout the project area and this practice will be located in these sites to control as well as to filter runoff in the associated drainage areas.  This practice will also be used in areas where grade is not an issue to trap runoff where adequate upland treatment cannot be obtained on private lands.   
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  3 structures
Wetland Restoration
The land use of the IGL Watershed has undergone dramatic changes post settlement with the bulk of the wetlands that once dominated the landscape now drained and converted to row crop production.   Many of these tile systems associated with these converted wetlands are brought to the surface directly into receiving water bodies flushing contaminants directly into the lakes.  These direct conduits for contaminants will be eliminated through the restorations or buried intakes will be installed for filtering purposes.  The Wetland Reserve Program will be used to fund the majority of these restorations but project funding may be used for some buried intakes.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  20 acres
Conservation Cover
The Conservation Reserve Program and all of its options for different conservation cover programs will be used to provide cover to key areas that perhaps are difficult to farm or should not have been farmed to begin with because of poor soil types or slopes.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  300 acres 
Filter Strips 
Filter strips promoted in critical locations and funded through the CRP program.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  40 acres
Lakeshore Revegetation
Due to the limited amount of shoreline vegetation found around most of the lakes, this practice will be implemented to stabilize windswept shorelines, filter contaminants from reaching the main body of the lake and to sequester nutrients while promoting aquatic habitat.
 Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  5,000 feet
Nutrient and Pesticide Management and Residue Management.
This practice will be implemented in identified priority areas to manage the amount, placement, and timing of crop inputs.  Due to the sensitive nature of this aquatic environment and the sheer amount of crop inputs applied throughout the watershed, it is imperative that an intense campaign be enacted to modify these activities.  Project sponsors will interface with producers and partners in addressing this issue through the support of project funding to encourage a higher level of stewardship.
 Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  4,000 acres 
The majority of the above listed practices will be focused in the yellow areas of Attachment 3, Figure 4 found on page 25 of this application and attachments. 
Urban Related Practices:
Construction Site Management
Urbanization is an ongoing issue in the IGL Watershed and additional incentives are needed to stimulate continued adoption of Low-Impact Development BMP’s.  Although ordinances have been adopted throughout much of the project area, instances still arise where incentives and cost-share are needed to meet overall project objectives.

These sediment basins can and often are designed using the NRCS terrace program and are for all practical purposes simply shorter terraces.  Basins are an effective alternative to waterways, which also allows the landowner, maintain a farmable row pattern.  Since much the slope of the land is not steep enough to require extensive terrace systems, in many instances, this practice, will have higher trapping efficiencies and is well-received by landowners.  
Further enhancing the adoption of this practice, traditional intake risers will be replaced with buried intakes to enhance the trapping efficiency of the system.  A significant amount of sediment is often flushed through the traditional riser but will be trapped in an underground matrix of soil and rock without interrupting row patterns.   This concept has been widely accepted throughout the county in the past and may well be the key aspect of the practice to entice landowner participation.
In other instances the where areas of concentrated flow are delivering high loads of sediment; this practice will be utilized in the more traditional sense as a catchment to trap pollutants and slow water.  These basins will be strategically located in small drainage areas where significant loading is occurring.  Under certain circumstances when inadequate protection can be obtained, these basins will also be utilized to cleanse runoff before reaching open water.
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  12 basins
Grade Stabilization Structures 
Classic gullies have been identified throughout the project area and this practice will be located in these sites to control as well as to filter runoff in the associated drainage areas.  This practice will also be used in areas where grade is not an issue to trap runoff where adequate upland treatment cannot be obtained on private lands.   
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  3 structures
Wetland Restoration
The land use of the IGL Watershed has undergone dramatic changes post settlement with the bulk of the wetlands that once dominated the landscape now drained and converted to row crop production.   Many of these tile systems associated with these converted wetlands are brought to the surface directly into receiving water bodies flushing contaminants directly into the lakes.  These direct conduits for contaminants will be eliminated through the restorations or buried intakes will be installed for filtering purposes.  The Wetland Reserve Program will be used to fund the majority of these restorations but project funding may be used for some buried intakes.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  20 acres
Conservation Cover
The Conservation Reserve Program and all of its options for different conservation cover programs will be used to provide cover to key areas that perhaps are difficult to farm or should not have been farmed to begin with because of poor soil types or slopes.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  300 acres 
Filter Strips 
Filter strips promoted in critical locations and funded through the CRP program.  
Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  40 acres
Lakeshore Revegetation
Due to the limited amount of shoreline vegetation found around most of the lakes, this practice will be implemented to stabilize windswept shorelines, filter contaminants from reaching the main body of the lake and to sequester nutrients while promoting aquatic habitat.
 Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  5,000 feet
Nutrient and Pesticide Management and Residue Management.
This practice will be implemented in identified priority areas to manage the amount, placement, and timing of crop inputs.  Due to the sensitive nature of this aquatic environment and the sheer amount of crop inputs applied throughout the watershed, it is imperative that an intense campaign be enacted to modify these activities.  Project sponsors will interface with producers and partners in addressing this issue through the support of project funding to encourage a higher level of stewardship.
 Projected Benefit
Project Installation Goal:  4,000 acres 
The majority of the above listed practices will be focused in the yellow areas of Attachment 3, Figure 4 found on page 25 of this application and attachments. 
Urban Related Practices:
Construction Site Management
Urbanization is an ongoing issue in the IGL Watershed and additional incentives are needed to stimulate continued adoption of Low-Impact Development BMP’s.  Although ordinances have been adopted throughout much of the project area, instances still arise where incentives and cost-share are needed to meet overall project objectives.

A targeted watershed approach will be used in the Iowa Great Lakes with this project application, but a keystone project will be featured within this project application in the heavily urbanized Center Lake Resource Management Area (RMA).  As identified in the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed Management Plan, urban runoff is the only remaining watershed concern in the Center Lake RMA as the map in the attachments shows.    

The Center Lake portion of this application will treat a full one third of the physical portion of the resource concern within the Center Lake RMA and remove 63 pounds of phosphorous from entering the lake annually.  In addition to 7 ( keystone) LID Practices for the Center Lake RMA, 5 additional LID Practices, 2 Grade Stabilization Practices, 3 Sediment Basins, 1 Wetland Restorations, 100 acres of CRP Incentives, and 17 Tile Intake Buffers will be applied within the targeted RMA’s of the Iowa Great Lakes.  

This project will mesh with the existing Iowa Great Lakes Watershed Management Plan because it will remove pollutants from RMA’s that have proven to be the biggest polluters of the Iowa Great Lakes and the impaired water bodies within the watershed as a whole.  This project will produce a relatively speedy Watershed Success Story as designs have already been finalized for the 7 keystone LID Practices so the practices can be built as soon as funding becomes available.  


Objectives
Our objectives are to reduce nutrients, primarily phosphorus, in one of the Tier 1 priority sub-watersheds identified in the Iowa Great Lakes WMP.  Our objective is to identify a 3 year work plan, as well as funding needed, in order to reduce phosphorous loads entering Center Lake and the other priority RMA’s.    Our objective includes constructing 7 primary low impact development practices pollutant filters and as quantity sponges.  We are also working with residential and development landowners to achieve water quality benefits in the critical urban interface where runoff meets residential development prior to reaching Center Lake.
Project practices in the remaining priority RMA’s will be conducted by the watershed coordinator as well as the Clean Water Alliance Coordinator.  The installation of these BMP’s will be considered success, but the list is by no means exhaustive.  For example, grassed waterways play an important role in the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed Management Plan but the practice is also a CRP practice and will be covered by the CRP incentive.  By utilizing other funding sources the accomplishments of this practice will be the minimum and the success of the project will be measured against these minimums.  


Methods
Methods Employed
We are utilizing low impact development practices to reduce nutrient loads reaching Center Lake and preventing them from passing through to West Okoboji Lake and the downstream chain of lakes. Construction of these LID practices includes pervious paver systems, bio-retention cells, rain gardens, and swales that are designed to slow the water and filter that water as it moves toward the lake.  
As part of this project a total of 7 primary LID Practices will be constructed and these practices will remove an astounding 18,984 pounds of sediment from entering Center Lake each year.  That sediment is typically heavily laden with total phosphorous, total nitrogen, and other pollutants typically found in urban runoff.  In addition the water typically has quantifiable hydrocarbons, zinc, copper, antifreeze, and other pollutants commonly associated with vehicles and developed areas.  
As part of the information and education campaign we hope to develop the desire in local residents to build smaller, secondary LID practices on their own property.  The Dickinson SWCD has cost share available to private landowners to construct these practices on their own land and several lake protective associations are willing to apply for funding as well.

As the Iowa Great Lakes project continues its targeted approach, the rural/urban East Okoboji Beach Resource Management Area (RMA), primarily agricultural Reeds Run RMA, and the more highly urban Lower Gar RMA will be focuses of this project's activities.  This project will continue goals of the watershed management plan, and begin to work on some of the final RMAs identified as primary pollutant sources by the TMDL and resultant WMP. Continued reductions in phosphorus and sediment will continue to improve Lower Gar Lake's turbidity, which is the source of the impairment for the Iowa Great Lakes system.

Objectives
The objectives are to reduce nutrients, primarily phosphorus, in the priority sub-watersheds identified in the Iowa Great Lakes WMP on an incremental basis. The objective of this project is to identify a 1-year work plan, as well as funding needed to reduce phosphorus loading from priority RMAs. This includes constructing identified low impact development practices (""Keystone LIDs"" from the WMP) that serve as essential pollutant filters and runoff reduction in the impacted urban areas in the watershed. The project is also working with residential and development landowners to achieve water quality benefits in the critical urban interface where runoff meets residential development prior to reaching any off the lakes.

Promoting project practices in the remaining priority RMA’s will be conducted by the watershed coordinator and other associated partners within the Dickinson Clean Water Alliance. The project has also recently been granted special status as a priority source water protection project within the NRCS EQIP structure, affording it additional practice implementation funds, primarily designated towards agricultural management practices that improve nitrate removal, with additional side benefits for phosphorus and sediment - mainly, cover crops.

Methods
Methods Employed
We are utilizing low impact development practices to reduce nutrient loads reaching the lakes and preventing them from passing downstream through the chain of lakes where the impaired Lower Gar Lake is the bottom of the chain. In the urban areas of the project, construction of the Keystone LID practices includes permeable pavement systems, bio-retention cells, rain gardens, and swales that are designed to slow the water and filter that water as it moves toward the lake. Primary practices in the agricultural areas include cover crops, filter strips, grassed waterways, reduced tillage, land retirement (conservation cover, CRP), underground tile inlets (also known as French drains or blind inlets), and wetland construction and restoration. Near-lake practices such as grade stabilization, shoreline protection/restoration, and filter strips will also be employed to reduce targeted pollutants.

"379","items",NA,"IA",112078,"Iowa Great Lakes","$112,694","	The Iowa Great Lakes Targeted Watershed Project is a continuation of a successful project in the Iowa Great Lakes area.  This project will specifically address the Resource Management Areas (RMA) outlined in the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed Plan.  This project will address Center Lake RMA, the last year of the Reeds Run RMA, and will address the Lower Gar Lake RMA and begin the East Okoboji Beach RMA in 2019.  In addition, we will begin work on the HWY 71 Urban RMA for LID practices.        

Inorganic suspended solids, phosphorus, and other substances contributing to poor water transparency are caused by sediment and phosphorus loads to the lake from surrounding land, other lake watersheds, and from sediment resuspended from the bottom of the lake.  This project will address suspended solids and phosphorus loads to the lake from erosion.  This approach is consistent with the Watershed Management Plan.        

To improve water quality and the overall health of Lower Gar Lake, the amount of sediment and phosphorus entering the lake from the watershed and other lakes must be reduced by 8,000 pounds, of which only 4,000 can be expected to be achieved from the Lower Gar Watershed.  The other 4,000 pounds needs to be reduced from the rest of the Iowa Great Lakes, according to the study conducted in 2010 by Dr. John Downing, Lower Chain Lakes, Diagnostic/Feasibilty Study and paid for by the Iowa DNR.        

The expected load reduction (delivery) for all of the Iowa Great Lakes for phosphorus at the end of this project is modeled to be 2,005.5 pounds of P.  The load reduction reaching Lower Gar will be much less and it would take additional research to determine how much of the 2,005.5 pounds reduction would have actually made it to Lower Gar Lake and the speed at which that reduction would be achieved as each lake has different retention rates within the watershed.  The breakdown of targeted load reductions of P delivered includes the following:
Lower Gar RMA – 286.8 lbs of Phosphorus per year
East Okoboji Beach RMA -- 235.5 lbs of Phosphorus the first year of this PIP
Elinor Bedell State Park RMA – 174.8 lbs of Phosphorus per year
Jemmerson Slough RMA -- 244.6 lbs of Phosphorus the second year of this PIP
Other RMA – 274.6 lbs per of Phosphorus per year
HWY 71 Urban RMA -- 26.5 lbs of Phosphorus per year.        

The project will have completed the following goals and objectives at the conclusion of this phase:  Complete the activities for the Okoboji View RMA on page 76, Center Lake RMA on page 109, Reeds Run RMA on page 142, Marble/Hottes RMA listed on Page 159 of the Watershed Management Plan, continue to implement the Reeds Run RMA activities listed on Page 143, and begin Lower Gar RMA on page 27 of the WMP.  In addition by the end of this project we will move to the finalization phase of the Polaris Urban RMA goals on page 192.  The project goals for this PIP include establishment of the following:
•	676 acres no-till, ridge-till, strip-till
•	1,240 acres cover crops
•	11,100 feet of grassed waterway
•	14 Water and Sediment Control Basins
•	8 wetland restorations
•	14 acres of filter strip or buffer strip
•	20 underground outlets
•	726 feet of shoreline restoration
•	86 acres of land retirement
•	10 Low Impact Development Practices
•	1 Urban Wetland Restoration/Creation
Or practices that equal the pollutant reduction as these practices according to the Watershed Management Plan.   
        
The project will continue the work in the Lower Gar RMA and finalize the East Okoboji Beach RMA activities and begin work on the Elinor Bedell RMA.  In addition, work will continue on the Urban RMA known as the HWY 71 Urban RMA.  Along with those priorities work will be done on the ""Other RMA"" as time and interest allows.  The WMP lists these RMAs on pages 28, 40, 48, 193 and 209.      

The Iowa Great Lakes is a valued resource by many ranging from individuals to large non-profit groups and government entities.  The Iowa Great Lakes has great popularity from a tourism perspective but also is emotionally known as ""home"" to many.  The Dickinson County Clean Water Alliance has been active in the watershed for nearly 25 years and has 81 partners whose stated goal is to improve the water quality of the Iowa Great Lakes.  Those 81 partners and the mission of the Clean Water Alliance are shown at www.cleanwateralliance.net.  
The Iowa Great Lakes value can be best demonstrated by the multiple fund raising efforts by the local people for conservation projects in recent years.  For example, the $7 million federal, state, and local dollars that was raised for the Anglers Bay bulrush bed protection efforts or the $900,000 local dollars raised just a couple years ago for an electronic fish barrier to prevent Asian carp from infesting the lakes.  
That committement is also there on an individual level where landowners and operators are commited to doing ""the right thing"" on their land.  Sometimes those landowners need to know what that right thing looks like and that is where this project comes into importance.  
Eighteen years ago, every city and the county pooled resources and formed the Dickinson County Water Quality Commission, which is an entity formed by a 28E agreement where money is contributed by the cities and the county, up to $200,000 dollars each year.  That money is used for specific water quality projects in Silver Lake, the Iowa Great Lakes, and Swan Lake in Eastern Dickinson County.  That funding source has since contributed over 3.6 million dollars and brought an estimated 25 million dollars back to the county through private, local, state, and federal funds.   
This Water Quality Commission has granted out nearly 3 million dollars in that time and has brought over an additional 27 million in matching dollars for projects in the Iowa Great Lakes, Silver Lake, and Little Swan Lake of Dickinson County.

"380","items",NA,"CO",103394,"Tools to Address Agricultural Nutrient Nonpoint Source Contamination","$80,138","Overview
This project will create two resources that will contribute guidance and centralization to the problem of agricultural nutrient nonpoint source pollution in Colorado. First, the project will build a comprehensive decision support tool that guides a user faced with potential nutrient management issues through the process of problem description to BMP recommendation. The basis of this tool will be a clearinghouse of nutrient BMPs described by published literature that addresses methods of controlling nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nonpoint source agricultural contamination. Coupled with field and watershed characteristics provided as user input, this tool will direct the user to potential BMPs, along with their estimated cost of implementation, maintenance requirements and background research. Users will have the option of interfacing with the clearinghouse through a participatory geographic information system (GIS) that operates on a web platform to further investigate site-specific suitability of selected BMPs to maximize economic effectiveness. This web platform will be integrated with the Environmental Risk Assessment and Management System (eRAMs) under development at Colorado State University (CSU). The publically available eRAMS technology facilitates the assessment, siting and implementation of conservation practices to reduce sediment, nutrient and pesticide losses. Since it is a web-based platform, it does not require the user to upload additional software with associated updates and fees. 

Concurrently, to gain user and stakeholder acceptance of the BMPs catalogued under the nutrient BMP clearinghouse, a special advisory task force will be convened to provide input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality as well as advise the development of the GIS integrated BMP tool. This task force will be modeled after the successful groundwater BMP advisory committee that currently serves the Agricultural Chemicals and Groundwater Protection Program authorized by the Colorado Department of Agriculture. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the duration of the project. 


Objectives
Objective 1: Improve the access, reliability and understanding of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices. 

Objective 2: Enable users of the nutrient management clearinghouse to assess the suitability, economic feasibility and practicality of BMPs using a site-specific, user friendly GIS platform.

Objective 3: Identify nutrient practices, tools and procedures that do not currently have a sufficient research base to support their recommendation and adoption for conditions in Colorado.
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.




Methods
Objective 1
Task 1 – Nutrient BMP Clearinghouse: Researchers at Colorado State University will develop a clearinghouse of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that have peer-reviewed supporting research for irrigated agriculture in the Western U.S. This clearinghouse will only include BMPs that are supported by published data and literature to reduce losses of nutrient to surface and groundwater. This web-served database will be searchable by multiple factors affecting nutrient origin and transport, such as the cropping system, irrigation system and management, and soil type. The cost of implementation will be included, where available, and effectiveness per unit of nutrient removed. Most importantly, the clearinghouse will focus on BMPs appropriate to and researched in irrigated agricultural systems similar to Colorado. The clearinghouse will also include a section that provides currently available tools for nutrient management in Colorado, including fertility recommendations, calculators, software and other resources to improve nutrient use efficiency and prevent movement in irrigated agricultural systems.  

Objective 1
Task 2 – Nutrient BMP Task Force: Convene an agricultural nutrient BMP task force to review and define appropriate existing nutrient BMPs for the clearinghouse. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the project length and give input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality.
Objective 2
Task 3 products: An online, integrated toolbox of nutrient management practices and tools that allows users to assess the benefits, costs and effectiveness of nutrient BMP at the field and watershed scale. Create outreach publications, user manual, help pages and assessment mechanisms. Outcome measurements of Task 3 will involve online user online feedback and website statistics.
Objective 3
Task 4 – Identify Research Gaps: In the third phase of this project, we will use data and knowledge gaps identified in Task 1 to identify potential nutrient BMPs that have not been sufficiently tested for effectiveness and practicality under irrigated agricultural conditions similar to Colorado. 
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.

Task 5-Project Administration: Manage the project transparently and openly, providing regular updates to partners and funder. Provide progress, semi-annual, and final reports as laid out in the grant agreement. Manage project financially using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and following grant requirements. Complete draw down requests monthly. Project staff will seek review and approval on language within outreach materials before they are finalized.

Goal: Technical assistance and implementation support of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, streambank and shoreline erosion control to limit nutrients and sediment in runoff from urban lands.  

Introduction: The Virginia Stormwater Management Act of 2004, consolidated Virginia's stormwater management programs within the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and transferred oversight responsibilities to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board from the Board of Conservation and Recreation. This legislation has had a significant impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s stormwater management capability.  

Description: DCR staff will provide technical guidance and advice to local governments, state and federal land management agencies, environmental regulatory agencies, community groups, watershed management planners and private citizens. Technical staff will assist in comprehensive local program reviews of erosion and sediment control and urban stormwater management programs in order to note and correct deficiencies. Staff will also provide comprehensive watershed planning advice and training to urbanizing localities that have adopted erosion and sediment control, subdivision, drainage, stormwater, and other land development ordinances that address stormwater management.  Further, DCR staff directly review, approve, and oversee implementation of construction and maintenance plans for Best Management Practices (BMPs) on state agency projects to ensure compliance with the Regulations.  

Results will include subsequent improved status of reviewed local programs to gain compliance with state laws. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by these positions. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the program during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities. Staff will be involved in local projects as needed and as assigned by regional office or program management to address situational issues or to provide design recommendations. 


Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) base funding will be used to support three regional Stormwater Compliance engineers/Specialists  (project #7) located in the Dublin, James and Suffolk regional DSWC offices. These positions will provide technical assistance to local, state, and federal agencies in the implementation of the Stormwater Management Law and Regulations and the Construction and Development elements of the Nonpoint Source Management Program.  These positions will not be directly involved in the permitting of projects through the Virginia Stormwater Management Program Permit Regulations, or as directed by federal grant guidance, these positions will not be directly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES program responsibilities.

Program Income: If any fees or funds are generated through the Stormwater Management certification and/or training programs these will be utilized for program activities and reported to EPA.

Location: The Department of Conservation and Recreation has assigned these urban program engineers to the following regional offices:
1.	James/Henrico - Covers 44 localities in northern and central Virginia, most of which are subject to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act
2.	Dublin - Covers 49 localities serving predominately the New River Watershed in the southwestern portion of the state
3.	Suffolk - Covers 33 localities covering southeastern Virginia, the Hampton Roads/Virginia Beach area, and the eastern shore, most of which are subject to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act.

Goal: Technical assistance and implementation support of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, streambank and shoreline erosion control to limit nutrients and sediment in runoff from urban lands.  

Introduction: The Virginia Stormwater Management Act of 2004, consolidated Virginia's stormwater management programs within the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and transferred oversight responsibilities to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board from the Board of Conservation and Recreation. This legislation has had a significant impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s stormwater management capability.  

Description: DCR staff will provide technical guidance and advice to local governments, state and federal land management agencies, environmental regulatory agencies, community groups, watershed management planners and private citizens. Technical staff will assist in comprehensive local program reviews of erosion and sediment control and urban stormwater management programs in order to note and correct deficiencies. Staff will also provide comprehensive watershed planning advice and training to urbanizing localities that have adopted erosion and sediment control, subdivision, drainage, stormwater, and other land development ordinances that address stormwater management.  Further, DCR staff directly review, approve, and oversee implementation of construction and maintenance plans for Best Management Practices (BMPs) on state agency projects to ensure compliance with the Regulations.  

Results will include subsequent improved status of reviewed local programs to gain compliance with state laws. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by these positions. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the program during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities. Staff will be involved in local projects as needed and as assigned by regional office or program management to address situational issues or to provide design recommendations.

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.
DEQ will enter into a interagency pass-thru agreement with DCR to administer this objective. DCR will manage FTEs, procure goods/services and develop sub-recipient agreements for this work.
Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce NPS of both surface and groundwater. The mission of the NM (NM) program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters. DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources to improve efficient nutrient uptake by plants, which minimizes loss to the environment, thus protecting
the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. NM specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers and develop site-specific NM plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields.

Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) NPS Program funding will be used to support the NM Program Manager and the NM Training and Certification Coordinator both based in the DCR central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 NM Specialists who will be housed in agency field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement all NM (NM) and urban NM (UN) milestone goals in the Virginia NPS Pollution Management Program Plan. In addition this Objective implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan. Restriction of Funding: As directed by Federal grant
guidance, these positions will not be directly or indirectly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES/VPDES program responsibilities or activities (including writing plans in order to write, obtain, implement or adhere to a point source discharge permit). This includes working in any capacity with impacted CAFOs (those with or applying for NPDES/VPDES permits).
Program Income: It is not anticipated that any program income will be generated from this Objective. The Section 319(h) program only pays for the training coordinator; any costs related to holding the trainings are paid for by sources other than 319. If any fees or funds are generated through the certification and/or training programs these will be exclusively utilized for program activities and reported to EPA at the end of the grant cycle. This is a requirement in State regulation that all money generated from NM training be used for the trainings. If program
income is generated this will be reported to Virginia’s EPA Project Officer and will be identified to EPA on the Interim and Final FFR.

"391","items",NA,"CO",103394,"Tools to Address Agricultural Nutrient Nonpoint Source Contamination","$80,138","Overview
This project will create two resources that will contribute guidance and centralization to the problem of agricultural nutrient nonpoint source pollution in Colorado. First, the project will build a comprehensive decision support tool that guides a user faced with potential nutrient management issues through the process of problem description to BMP recommendation. The basis of this tool will be a clearinghouse of nutrient BMPs described by published literature that addresses methods of controlling nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nonpoint source agricultural contamination. Coupled with field and watershed characteristics provided as user input, this tool will direct the user to potential BMPs, along with their estimated cost of implementation, maintenance requirements and background research. Users will have the option of interfacing with the clearinghouse through a participatory geographic information system (GIS) that operates on a web platform to further investigate site-specific suitability of selected BMPs to maximize economic effectiveness. This web platform will be integrated with the Environmental Risk Assessment and Management System (eRAMs) under development at Colorado State University (CSU). The publically available eRAMS technology facilitates the assessment, siting and implementation of conservation practices to reduce sediment, nutrient and pesticide losses. Since it is a web-based platform, it does not require the user to upload additional software with associated updates and fees. 

Concurrently, to gain user and stakeholder acceptance of the BMPs catalogued under the nutrient BMP clearinghouse, a special advisory task force will be convened to provide input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality as well as advise the development of the GIS integrated BMP tool. This task force will be modeled after the successful groundwater BMP advisory committee that currently serves the Agricultural Chemicals and Groundwater Protection Program authorized by the Colorado Department of Agriculture. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the duration of the project. 


Objectives
Objective 1: Improve the access, reliability and understanding of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices. 

Objective 2: Enable users of the nutrient management clearinghouse to assess the suitability, economic feasibility and practicality of BMPs using a site-specific, user friendly GIS platform.

Objective 3: Identify nutrient practices, tools and procedures that do not currently have a sufficient research base to support their recommendation and adoption for conditions in Colorado.
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.




Methods
Objective 1
Task 1 – Nutrient BMP Clearinghouse: Researchers at Colorado State University will develop a clearinghouse of nutrient management (non-structural) and structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that have peer-reviewed supporting research for irrigated agriculture in the Western U.S. This clearinghouse will only include BMPs that are supported by published data and literature to reduce losses of nutrient to surface and groundwater. This web-served database will be searchable by multiple factors affecting nutrient origin and transport, such as the cropping system, irrigation system and management, and soil type. The cost of implementation will be included, where available, and effectiveness per unit of nutrient removed. Most importantly, the clearinghouse will focus on BMPs appropriate to and researched in irrigated agricultural systems similar to Colorado. The clearinghouse will also include a section that provides currently available tools for nutrient management in Colorado, including fertility recommendations, calculators, software and other resources to improve nutrient use efficiency and prevent movement in irrigated agricultural systems.  

Objective 1
Task 2 – Nutrient BMP Task Force: Convene an agricultural nutrient BMP task force to review and define appropriate existing nutrient BMPs for the clearinghouse. Experts from the agricultural industry, academia, farmers, ranchers and agency personnel will be recruited for this task force. The task force will meet throughout the project length and give input on BMP effectiveness, cost, and practicality.
Objective 2
Task 3 products: An online, integrated toolbox of nutrient management practices and tools that allows users to assess the benefits, costs and effectiveness of nutrient BMP at the field and watershed scale. Create outreach publications, user manual, help pages and assessment mechanisms. Outcome measurements of Task 3 will involve online user online feedback and website statistics.
Objective 3
Task 4 – Identify Research Gaps: In the third phase of this project, we will use data and knowledge gaps identified in Task 1 to identify potential nutrient BMPs that have not been sufficiently tested for effectiveness and practicality under irrigated agricultural conditions similar to Colorado. 
Objective 4: Manage project in a timely and cost effective manner including project reporting, invoice preparation and grant administration.

Task 5-Project Administration: Manage the project transparently and openly, providing regular updates to partners and funder. Provide progress, semi-annual, and final reports as laid out in the grant agreement. Manage project financially using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and following grant requirements. Complete draw down requests monthly. Project staff will seek review and approval on language within outreach materials before they are finalized.

The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission (ANRC) under 2006-2010 Non Point Source (NPS) pollution Management Program has identified the following eight watersheds as priority watersheds for addressing known water quality problems:

1. Lake Conway Point Remove (PR)
2. Bayou Bartholomew
3. L’Anguille
4. Beaver Reservoir
5. Illinois River
6. Lower Little River
7. Poteau River
8. Upper Saline River

Depending on the geo-morphological characteristics of each of the eight priority watersheds, several sources (e.g., agriculture, silviculture, resource extraction, surface erosion, or households and business activities) and the causes (e.g., sediment, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, pathogens, etc.) have been identified as the main contributor of non point source pollution (ANRC, 2005). In order to cost effectively manage sources and causes of non point source pollution, the ANRC plans to encourage implementation of mitigation efforts at sub-watershed scale within the identified priority watersheds. 

To generate information for decision making at sub-watershed scale, the ANRC funded studies that resulted in the development of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models at the 8-digit and 10-digit HUC for a majority of the eight priority watersheds (Project # 05-120).  The model results have produced a prioritized ranking of the identified watersheds based on their contribution to flow, sediment, and nutrients at the major watershed outlet. 

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has recently made available sub-watershed (12-digit HUC) scale data for the state of Arkansas (Figure 1-3). It is clear from these figures that the number of sub-watersheds at 12-digit HUC scale have increased by approximately three fold compared to 10-digit HUC data. Geomorphologic resolution of sub-watersheds have been reported to quite dramatically affect the SWAT model flow, sediment and nutrient outputs ( Bingner et al.,1997; Mamillapalli, 1998; FitzHugh and MacKay,2000; Jha et al. ,2004; and Arabi et al., 2006).  Thus, ranking of sub-watersheds within each of the eight priority watersheds based on their contribution to flow, sediment, and nutrients (“hot spots”) must be performed at 12-digit HUC scale while deciding about the sub-watersheds of concern and the monitoring needs thereto. In keeping up with this realization, the ANRC has recently funded a proposal for developing prioritized sub-watersheds based on their contribution to NPS pollution at 12-digit HUC scale for L’Anguille watershed (Project # 04-121). We propose to generate similarly ranked sub-watersheds for the rest of the seven priority watersheds using SWAT model in two phases. The phasing will provide the flexibility to schedule the modeling of watersheds in consultation with the ANRC. In the first phase that runs from 2008-2010, we propose to develop a 12-digit prioritized model for Lake Conway Point Remove (PR), Bayou Bartholomew, Beaver Reservoir, and Illinois River watersheds as per consultations with the ANRC.

After addressing the question of prioritized sub-watersheds, the next step would be to identify the sources of sediment and nutrients for each of these high priority 12-digit HUC sub-watersheds. The identification of sources will be accomplished by site visits of each of the high priority sub-watersheds, collecting information on impairments (e.g., loss of riparian vegetation, land disturbance, stream bank erosion), and remote sensing data, to quantify sources of problem areas.  Detailed observation will be collected on sources of sediment, nutrients, and site conditions that result in NPS pollution.  Aerial/Satellite data will be procured to identify sources of NPS pollution. The areas that are identified will be ground-truthed by site visits.      

The identification of sources of NPS pollutants within each priority sub-watershed will be followed by an identification of candidate BMPs that will reduce transport of NPS pollutants, quantification of the effects of these BMPs and, subsequently, an assessment about the critical source required to achieve predicted reduction in sediment and nutrient loadings. This effort will initially be carried out for at least one top priority sub-watershed within each of the selected four priority watersheds. Recent studies have shown that the SWAT model can be successfully used for quantifying the long term impacts of BMPs implemented in reducing the nonpoint source pollution (sediment and nutrients) at the farm level and watershed level (Santhi et al., 2006; Arabi et al., 2006; Arabi et al., 2007). Known BMP areas within prioritized watersheds will be compared with non-BMP areas and simulations performed assuming the identified BMPs are extended over a greater percentage of land area within a watershed to assess the impacts of BMP installation over larger areas. This information will be useful in deciding about the size of critical source area over which the BMPs be installed for achieving the predicted reductions in sediment and nutrient loadings at the watershed scale.

All the information developed in this project can become a part of the nine element watershed management plan.  Similarly, the identified BMPs for the hot spots may be used for providing funding for their actual installation and monitoring in future.


Objectives
To calibrate the SWAT model at the 12-digit HUC scale so that sub-watersheds within the 8-digit HUCs of Lake Conway Point Remove (PR), Bayou Bartholomew, Beaver Reservoir, and Illinois River watersheds are assessed and ranked based on their contribution to non point source (NPS) pollution.

Methods
1) Financial Review; 2) Develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP); 3) Collect and organize 12-digit sub-watershed scale data needed for SWAT modeling; 4) Calibrate and validate SWAT model for water quality response predictions; 5) Identify and Prioritize 12-digit HUC sub-watersheds based on their relative contribution to flow, sediment and nutrient losses; 6) Identify key contributing areas (hot spots) of sediment and nutrients within each high priority 12-digit HUC sub-watersheds based on ground-truthing and remote sensing data; 7) Create a database of BMPs implemented within each of the four selected priority watersheds using state/federal or other funding sources.; 8) Analyze pre and post BMP scenario for the top ranked sub-watershed within each of the four selected priority watersheds by simulating farm level and watershed level reduction in sediment and nutrient loadings achieved through selected BMPs.; and 9) Reporting.","N","Project Implementation","11010001","110100010504","N","07/01/2008","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:33782"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,169106
"398","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

sufficient data are available to analyze (i.e., approximately five years of data collection at a
minimum). This project will specifically focus on determining water-quality trends at select sites
within the Beaver Reservoir and Illinois River Priority Watersheds, including Ballard Creek,
Osage Creek, Illinois River, White River, West Fork White River and the Kings River. Waterquality
trends will be analyzed using flow-weighted constituent concentrations, and parametric
and non-parametric statistical techniques to determine if constituent concentrations are
increasing, decreasing or not changing over time.

This proposal is for water quality sampling and water sample analysis at seven sites within the Upper White River Basin: West Fork of the White River, White River near Fayetteville, Richland Creek, Brush Creek, War Eagle Creek, and Town Branch and one of its tributaries.  The parameters measured in the field include these physio-chemical parameters: pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration.  These parameters will be analyzed in the collected water samples: major anions (nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), sulfate (SO4), and chloride (Cl)), soluble reactive P (PO4-P; SRP), total P (TP), dissolved ammonia (NH3-N), total N (TN), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity.  In addition, constituent loads will be determined using the relation between constituent concentrations and discharge to estimate daily loads, which are then summed to produce monthly, seasonal and annual load estimates.  

The selected sites encompass the Upper White River Basin in Arkansas, and these sites represent the one site on the White River downstream from the confluence of its three branches, and the other three major inflows into Beaver Lake (i.e., Brush Creek, Richland Creek and War Eagle Creek).  These sites are also representative of various land uses within the Beaver Lake Watershed, including catchments that are pasture dominated (Brush Creek) and that are dominated by urban, residential, and industrial development (Town Branch and its tributary). Two of the sites, West Fork of the White River and White River near Fayetteville, are on stream segments identified as impaired by ADEQ. Three of the sites; Richland Creek, Town Branch and Town Branch Tributary; are on direct tributaries to those streams, or to the impaired segment of Beaver Lake. The other two sites represent more rural systems and are included to provide a better range of land uses.  ANRC has been funding sampling at three of the proposed sites, White River, West Fork of the White and Town Branch, for several years.  Because of the change in sampling protocol, the four additional sites can be added at little additional cost over previous projects.  The addition of the four sites also provides for better characterization of water quality in the basin.  The selected parameters provide for calibration of watershed models for future planning of BMP scenarios as well as assessment of programs designed to reduce TSS and nutrient trends in the streams and Beaver Lake.  The selected parameters are also those that have long term records available in the database and are included in the standard suite of parameters normally monitored in the Arkansas Ozarks.  

Beaver Water District will be the contractor with Arkansas Natural Resources Commission (ANRC) for the 319 grant.  Beaver Water District, in cooperation with the City of Fayetteville and contingent upon approval of the Fayetteville City Council, and the sub-contractor will be responsible for providing the project matching funds. Beaver Water District will be responsible for the QAPP and quarterly and final reports to ANRC.  The sub-contractor will be responsible for all remaining tasks of the project including: collecting samples, analyzing the data from the water quality sampling stations, and computing the annual load for all parameters.


Objectives
Collect and analyze weekly or more frequent grab samples at seven sites in the White River Basin in Arkansas, and estimate annual constituent loads at each of these sites.

Methods
Water samples will be collected manually from bridge accesses at seven sites within the White River Basin including Brush Creek, Richland Creek, Town Branch and its tributary, War Eagle Creek, West Fork White River, and the White River (Appendix 05).  Water samples will be collected at the bridges on Brush Creek at Highway 45 (USGS Station No. 07048890), on Richland Creek at Highway 45 (USGS Station No. 07048800), on Town Branch at Fayetteville (USGS Station No. 07048480) and its tributary (USGS Station No. 07048490), War Eagle Creek near Hindesville (USGS Station No. 07049000), West Fork White River east of Fayetteville (USGS Station No. 07048550), and the White River near Fayetteville (USGS Station No. 07048600) (see Appendix 5).  The water samples will be collected using an Alpha style horizontal sampler or a Kemmerer type vertical sampler near the vertical centroid of flow, i.e. middle of channel where water is actively moving.  Water samples will be collected at these seven sites starting July 2009 at an average of one sample every 168 hours and depending on drainage (watershed) area, flow, etc., and this frequency may be increased or decreased depending upon these characteristics.  Before beginning sampling, each site selected will have the sampling frequency determined and approved by ANRC and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is anticipated that the sites at the Richland Creek, War Eagle Creek, West Fork White River, and the White River will likely require weekly water sampling, whereas the other sites including Brush Creek, Town Branch and its tributary will likely require more frequent water sample collection (e.g., twice a week).  The monitoring program will be adjusted to insure that a sufficient fraction of the collected samples represent storm event or surface runoff conditions following episodic rainfall events, including small and large storm events.

Water samples will be analyzed on site for physico-chemical parameters including pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration.  All water samples will be delivered to a certified Water Quality Lab (WQL) and analyzed for major anions (nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), sulfate (SO4), and chloride (Cl)), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4-P), total P (TP), dissolved ammonia (NH3-N), total N (TN), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity).  The certified WQL will use standard laboratory quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures during analyses.  Duplicate samples will be collected at a frequency of 10% throughout the duration of the project, and these duplicate water samples will be collected in the same fashion as the original sample and then analyzed at the certified WQL for the same parameters.  All concentration data will be reported with field and laboratory QA/QC data in the final report to Beaver Water District and ANRC.
 
Constituent loads will be estimated at seven of the nine sites where the USGS records streamflow data.  Constituent loads (L) will be estimated using various statistical techniques, including simple log–log regression of concentration (C) and discharge (Q), and also seasonal factors (e.g., Fourier’s equation with sin(2πT) and cos(2πT)).  A software package such as USGS LOADEST will be used to estimate constituent loads, and the typical equation used to estimate constituent loads can be represented by:
ln (C) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)
ln (L) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)

The LOADEST software program estimates daily concentrations or loads which are then summed to represent monthly, seasonal, and annual load estimates.  

Quarterly progress and quality assurance reports and a final report will be prepared for this project. The report will detail the sampling results for the project period as well as calculated annual constituent loads for the water quality parameters measured.  The final report will detail concentrations observed, regression equations used in load estimation, and annual load estimate at the site; Payment of the sub-contractor will be a lump sum, 25% of the total each quarter after submission of the quarter reports on 30 September 2009, 31 December 2009, 31 March 2010, 30 June 2010 and submission of the final report on 31 July 2010. The final payment will be withheld until the final report has been received by ANRC.

The goal of the project is to restore unstable sections of streams and rivers in the upper White River watershed to reduce sediment loads from banks, improve water quality, and enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitat.

Objectives
The project objectives are :
1)	Identify impaired streambanks in the upper White River watershed.
2)	Prioritize streambanks by predicting annual streambank erosion rates (tons/yr) using BEHI and NBS ratings (BANCS Model).
3)	Develop a site specific restoration plan for two sites (Kings River and Bull Shoals Tailwater) which addresses stream instability, landowner and local objectives, maximizes sediment reduction, and maximizes habitat restoration.
4)	Reduce sediment loadings to streams/rivers from accelerated streambank erosion.
5)	Restore riparian areas and protect existing riparian areas along with enhancement of terrestrial habitat and increase aquatic habitat in the stream watershed.
6)	Increase awareness and promote the use of natural channel design among landowners and the public. 


Methods
Specific project tasks and description are as follows:

Task 1: Financial Audit: A financial review of all financial records by CPA following agreed upon procedures.

Task 2: Site Visits, Measurements, and Prioritization/ Restoration Plan Development for sites on Kings River and Bull Shoals Tailwater:  The major tributaries and mainstem upper White River will be surveyed to develop a prioritized list of streambank improvement projects.  Site prioritization will be based on predictions of annual streambank erosion rates (tons/yr) using BEHI (Bank Erosion Habitat Index) and NBS (Near Bank Stress) ratings (BANCS Model).  Landowners will at this point be given opportunity to voice any concerns over proposed plans before proceeding to Task 3.  It will be made clear to landowners that proceeding to Task 3 indicates their full intentions to implement proposed restoration plans.  Sites chosen will be “blue line” streams on a 7.5 minute USGS quadrangle.  Two actively eroding streambanks have been located.  Both sites will have a unique set of plans developed to tailor to each site’s erosion causes.  Bioengineering will be an integral part of success at each site.  At this stage the landowners will once again be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed restoration plans.  Afterwards a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permit request will be submitted for each site.

Revise and improve Beaver Lake Watershed Protection Strategy to address EPA suggestions and develop outreach program for watershed conservation.

Objectives
We propose to make the following revisions to the BLWPS according to the initial EPA review:

1.	Introduce a timeline and structure for an adaptive management approach to include periodic reevaluation and adjustment of work plans, 5, 10, and 15 year goals, etc., and clarification of the overall timeline originally included in the document.
2.	Clarify strategic prioritization of sub-watershed for work.
3.	Correlate the BLWPS with the EPA’s 9 Elements in matrix format as an appendix
4.	Address EPA concerns regarding “maintenance” of water quality versus “improvement” in the general philosophical underpinnings of the WPS.
5.	Develop and introduce additional content to address other pollutants (e.g., Beryllium)

The project will begin in March 2012 and will be completed by 31 May 2012.  Milestones for success are the individual revision and outreach steps outlined below.

March 2012:
•	Development of key ideas and initial outline of revision (see above for proposed revisions)

April 2012:
•	Solicit expert opinion and input by reconvening the original Technical and Policy Advisory Groups 
•	Incorporate input from advisory groups and research and make final revisions

May 2012:
•	Present revisions to advisory groups
•	Create summary information page for public distribution
•	Create website to host and distribute final document and to promote and list work on the watershed.
•	Provide a schedule for implementing the NPS management measures identified above that is reasonably expeditious.

Success of this project will be marked by the production and resubmission of a Beaver Lake Watershed Protection Strategy for EPA acceptance that has been developed through and with the buy-in of the various stakeholders for Beaver Lake water quality as represented by the Technical and Policy Advisory Groups.  Additional measures of success include a user-friendly website for hosting the document and to serve as a clearinghouse for restoration and improvement projects on the watershed.

The life of the BLWPS moving into the future and various restoration projects and best management practices implemented as a result of the document represent the sustained progress of the revision project after funds are expended.


Methods
1) Financial Audit; 2) Document Revision and Distribution; 3) Public Outreach and Education; 3) Reporting

Success of the project will be marked by a fully revised Beaver Lake Watershed Protection Strategy that is ready for resubmission to the EPA.","N","Project Implementation","11010001","110100010504","N","03/19/2012","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:76741"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,19918

All water samples will be delivered to the Arkansas Water Resources Center Water Quality Lab (AWRC WQL) and analyzed for nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), chloride (Cl), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and conductivity.  The AWRC WQL will use standard laboratory quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures during analyses.  Duplicate samples will be collected at a frequency of 10% throughout the duration of the project, and these duplicate water samples will be collected in the same fashion as the original sample and then analyzed at the AWRC WQL for the same parameters.  All concentration data will be reported with field and laboratory QA/QC data in the final report to ANRC.

Constituent loads will be estimated each year where the USGS or AWRC records streamflow data.  Constituent loads (L) will be estimated using various statistical techniques, including simple log–log regression of concentration (C) and discharge (Q), and also seasonal factors (e.g., Fourier’s equation with sin(2πT) and cos(2πT)).  The typical equation used to estimate constituent loads can be represented by:
ln (C) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)
ln (L) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)
The majority of these sites are at existing U.S. Geological Survey discharge monitoring stations, and this project relies on the use of the stream discharge data (available through the USGS Arkansas Water Science Center web site or its National Water Information System NWIS database).  The AWRC will work closely with the USGS to receive up-to-date data, and the use of provisional USGS data might occur during the final year of the project.  There are three sites proposed within this monitoring project, Sager Creek, White River at Goshen and Town Branch, which do not have established USGS discharge monitoring stations.  The AWRC will measure discharge at Sager Creek at least once a month using an acoustic Doppler current meter during base flow or wade-able conditions, or an acoustic Doppler current profiler during storm event conditions or other suitable device.  These discharge measurements will be used to adjust the rating curves used to estimate discharge records at Sager Creek. To estimate discharge at the White River at Goshen, AWRC will apply a conversion factor based on catchment area differences and effluent discharge to the discharge recorded by USGS at the White River at Fayetteville. A gaging station is expected to be installed with the USGS at Town Branch through activities by the City of Fayetteville, and this gaging station should be functional by the summer of 2015.
 
If this project is funded by the ANRC 319 program, then it will provide a decade worth of monitoring data at each of these sites following consistent sampling program – this period of record is sufficient to evaluate trends in constituent concentrations and loads.  The trends will be determined using these three steps:

1)	Measured constituent concentrations and associated discharge will be log-transformed to account for the typical log-distribution of water quality data and to minimize the influence of outliers (Step 1)

2)	Log-transformed concentrations will be adjusted against log-transformed discharge using locally weighted regression analysis (LOESS), a two dimensional smoothing technique; the residuals (or the observed value minus the LOESS predicted value) represent the flow-adjusted concentrations (Step 2).

3)	Flow-adjusted concentrations (derived from the residuals of the log-transformed concentration and discharge relation) will be analyzed for trends over the period of record using parametric regression analysis, LOESS smoothing, and possibly regression tree analysis to determine how and when water quality is changing over time (Step 3).

The LOESS analysis will be based on a sampling proportion of 0.5 and a first order polynomial function, which has been typically used in other studies evaluating water quality trends in Arkansas and other regional streams.  The end product will be very similar to that produce by Haggard (2010) and Scott et al. (2011) and in ANRC project 11-500 (due in September 2015).  However, this trend analysis will limit itself to the time period from July 2009 through June 2018, where water quality changes have not been evaluated and monitoring was conducted following the same protocols across these sites.

Quarterly progress and quality assurances reports, three annual reports and a final report will be prepared for this project.  The annual reports will detail the sampling results for the project period as well as calculated annual constituent loads for the water quality parameters measured.  The final report will detail concentrations observed, regression equations used in load estimation, annual load estimates at these sites, and any observed changes in water quality over the period of record at these sites (i.e., up to the last decade).  Payment will be task-based after the submission of the quarterly reports on or before 15 January 2016, 15 April 2016, 15 July 2016, 15 October 2016, 15 January 2017, 15 April 2017, 15 July 2017, 15 October 2017, 15 January 2018, 15 April 2018, 15 July 2018, and 15 October 2018.  The final payment will be withheld until the final report has been received by ANRC on or before 30 December 2018, and the final report due three months after the monitoring ends will allow more than sufficient time to evaluate water quality data, estimate loads, and determine water quality trends.

"405","items",NA,"AR",98290,"Connecting NPS Management to Receiving Streams through BMP Education and Demonstration","$248,467","Overview
This project will build upon previous EPA 319 projects including FY00-400, FY02-1900, FY05-1000, FY06-1900, FY09-1700 and FY13-1400. Education and engagement efforts will be broadened and refined to address urban stakeholders’ lack of understanding that NPS pollution is inclusive of resident activities and contributes to water quality degradation of receiving waters. This will be accomplished through the installation of storm drain inlet and LID BMP demonstrations coordinated with an outreach campaign utilizing innovative online social media and stakeholder engagement in NPS pollution prevention events. Techniques, challenges, and successes gleaned from this project will be shared with conservation organizations, LID professionals, jurisdictions, and agencies across Arkansas. This project will also showcase the utility of visual, digital and social media to better promote the link between residents’ activities and runoff flowing to receiving streams and increase voluntary adoption of NPS pollution prevention actions.

Best Management Practice Demonstrations:
The successful growth of the Upstream Art project validated that highly visible demonstration projects combined with stakeholder engagement can be an effective means of closing the aforementioned education gap of the urban stakeholders. Increased interest in LID techniques and green infrastructure in Northwest Arkansas has been evident through participation in UACES’ Blue Pathways workshops and the publication of the University of Arkansas Community Design Center’s LID design manual for urban areas. If these practices are to be more widely accepted, urban residents must be able to see and understand positive impacts of LID infrastructure and urban BMPs in their community. Demonstrations using soft engineering (rain gardens, bioswales, and riparian buffers) exist, but few make the connection to pollutants entering local waterways. In this project, storm drain drop inlet screens and filters will be installed along with LID demonstrations. Video and infographics of their relationship and functionality will highlight NPS pollutants including sediment, grass clipping/leaves and trash that are on the brink of entering receiving streams.  

Social Media and Digital Formats for NPS Education:
Public education and communication continues to rapidly shift to digital formats in the form of informative websites, online podcasts, downloadable print resources, interactive online learning tools and social media campaigns. While not abandoning traditional methods, a need exists to adapt NPS pollution prevention education to diverse audiences using more modern, efficient and accessible mediums that actively engage stakeholders in making the connection between urban NPS pollutants that enter storm drains and pollutants that accumulate in local waterways.

Last year, the Pew Research Center reported that 74% of online adults use social networking sites, 52% of online adults now use two or more social media sites, and 40% of traffic came from a mobile device. During the same time, online media blog Digital Insights also showed that nearly half of the 255 million active Twitter users tweet at least once a day, half of internet-using young adults ages 18-29 (53%) use Instagram, and over 6 billion hours of video is viewed per month on YouTube. Recent efforts initiated by UACES Washington County staff have demonstrated the outreach and engagement potential of digital and social media. In just two months of use, the volume and rate of information disseminated through multi-platform networks including Instagram and Twitter was exponentially more effective than previous traditional efforts such as mailings. Interacting within this community during this project will not only facilitate greater engagement, buy in, and feedback from stakeholders, but will also harness the influence and credibility of established partnerships.

Urban Resident Engagement:
Stream cleanups and other BMP activities have typically drawn a consistent number of stakeholders who provide crucial volunteer value and significant community enhancement through litter removal. However, the opportunity to more deeply engage this captive audience is often underutilized. Simply reporting volunteer numbers, organizations involved, and litter removed neglects the chance to more deeply engage stakeholders in connecting litter to its source. Tasks in this grant will better connect stakeholder efforts during and after events to the underlying cause and source of NPS pollution in the watershed by using innovative activities and interpretation. A series of GoPro camera videos will be created to visually document the path of NPS pollutants such as sediment, fertilizers or oil generated from urban activities from their source, across the landscape, through storm drains, culverts or major impervious drainage areas and into to local waterways.

This project will be considered successful if BMP demonstrations and educational materials and tools about NPS pollution and its direct connection to local water resources are accessed and electronically shared across the Beaver Reservoir, Illinois River and other watersheds of Arkansas. 

Objectives
Increase awareness and knowledge of Nonpoint Source (NPS) best management practices (BMP) to improve receiving stream water quality of the Beaver Reservoir and Illinois River Watersheds. Implement storm drain inlet and low impact development (LID) BMP demonstrations to reduce NPS pollution through public outreach, education, and engagement including signage, digital media, and community clean up events.

Methods
Task 1: Financial Audit
Annual reviews of all financial records will be completed through the federal A-133 audit performed by the State Auditor as part of the Single Statewide Audit. These statements will be prepared in accordance with general accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

Task 2: Planning and Input
Project staff will collaborate with GIS, engineering, public works, transportation and parks staff in Fayetteville and Springdale to acquire baseline mapping and data for small catchments, identify inlets to install screen/filter BMP demonstrations, and garner logistical assistance for filming of NPS pollutant paths.

Task 3: Storm Drain BMP/LID Demonstrations
Project staff will acquire and install storm drain inlet screens and downspout and LID BMPs such as bioswales, cisterns and infiltration basins to demonstrate NPS reduction practices that limit pollutants from entering waterways via storm drains. 

Task 4: Public Education and Outreach
Pollutant pathway videos, inlet/LID demonstrations, and voluntary BMPs will be promoted through visible and accessible digital media including a wide social media presence, infographics, videos, PSAs, and local media coverage. High-quality signage that describes components and impact of demonstrations will be installed and promoted online. Other methods that promote NPS pollution prevention and green infrastructure will include trash removal from local waterways, public presentations, and partnering opportunities with the public, conservation organizations, municipalities, and businesses.

Task 5: Technology Transfer and Impact Assessment
Successful methods for LID and storm drain BMP implementation will be shared statewide with watershed organizations, cities, Chambers of Commerce, and state agencies. 

Task 6: Reporting
All reports will be prepared and submitted (hard copies and electronically) according to the grant requirements.
1.	Quarterly reports will be submitted utilizing the format/forms provided electronically by ANRC and will briefly state accomplishments made for each subtask. Quarterly reports will also include implementation documentation (forms provided electronically by ANRC).

Excessive nutrients and sediments have been cited as NPS pollution in northwest Arkansas, and this project will monitor these constituents and others which will add to the water quality database used by policy and decision makers of Arkansas.  

This proposal is for water quality sampling, analysis and annual load estimation at 13 sites in the Upper Illinois River Watershed and Upper White River Basin (i.e., Beaver Reservoir Watershed).  Water samples will be collected manually from the bridge access at the sampling sites (Table 2).  The water samples will be collected using an Alpha style horizontal sampler near the vertical centroid of flow i.e., in the middle of the channel where water is actively moving.  The water samples will be collected at these 13 monitoring sites starting October 2019 with 30 water samples being collected on average across each site.  The monitoring program will be adjusted to ensure the collection of water samples during storm events or surface runoff conditions following episodic rainfall events, including small and large storm events.

All water samples will be delivered to the Arkansas Water Resources Center Water Quality Lab (AWRC WQL) and analyzed for nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), chloride (Cl), sulfate (SO4), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and conductivity.  The AWRC WQL will use standard laboratory quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures during analyses.  Duplicate samples will be collected at a frequency of 10% throughout the duration of the project, and these duplicate water samples will be collected in the same fashion as the original sample and then analyzed at the AWRC WQL for the same parameters.  All concentration data will be reported with field and laboratory QA/QC data in the final report to ANRC.

Constituent loads will be estimated each year where the USGS or AWRC records streamflow data.  Constituent loads (L) will be estimated using various statistical techniques, including simple log–log regression of concentration (C) and discharge (Q), and also seasonal factors (e.g., Fourier’s equation with sin(2πT) and cos(2πT)).  The typical equation used to estimate constituent loads can be represented by:
ln (C) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)
ln (L) = β0 + β1 ln (Q) + β2 sin(2πT) + β3 cos(2πT)
These equations were successfully used in the previous 319 projects monitoring these sites to estimate constituent loads, and the loads estimated by the regression models compared well with loads estimated using auto-samplers where data was available for a six month time period.  This comparison suggested that ANRC’s decision to switch monitoring strategies did not compromise the quality of the load estimations (especially within the Upper Illinois River Watershed), and the switch also more than tripled the number of sites that were monitored.

The majority of these sites are at existing U.S. Geological Survey discharge monitoring stations, and this project relies on the use of the stream discharge data (available through the USGS Arkansas Water Science Center web site or its National Water Information System NWIS database).  The AWRC will work closely with the USGS to receive up-to-date data, and the use of provisional USGS data might occur during the final year of the project.

Water quality trends will be determined using these three steps:

1)	Measured constituent concentrations and associated discharge will be log-transformed to account for the typical log-distribution of water quality data and to minimize the influence of outliers (Step 1)

2)	Log-transformed concentrations will be adjusted against log-transformed discharge using locally weighted regression analysis (LOESS), a two dimensional smoothing technique; the residuals (or the observed value minus the LOESS predicted value) represent the flow-adjusted concentrations (Step 2).

3)	Flow-adjusted concentrations (derived from the residuals of the log-transformed concentration and discharge relation) will be analyzed for trends over the period of record using parametric regression analysis, LOESS smoothing, and possibly regression tree analysis to determine how and when water quality is changing over time (Step 3).

Quarterly progress and quality assurances reports, three annual reports and a final report will be prepared for this project.  The annual reports will detail the sampling results for the project period.  The final report will detail concentrations observed, regression equations used in load estimation, annual load estimates at these sites, and any observed changes in water quality over the period of record at these sites.

The overall project will involve much of the Umpqua Basin, a 3,000,653 acre watershed.  Elevated water temperatures exceed water quality criteria in much of the Umpqua Basin during the summer as noted in the 2006 TMDL. The land use is greatly varied throughout the Umpqua Basin including forest, agricultural, ranching, rural residential and urban.  

Objectives
The general goal is to gain knowledge of the thermal refugia conditions in the Umpqua River, specifically in the region between Elkton and Wolf Creek.  This project builds on work done in 2008 with modifications in field and analysis procedures.  This year, more synoptic river temperature data will be collected to better define the diurnal response of the sites as well as interaction between the sites and the main body of the river.

"410","items",NA,"MN",81700,"Middle Minnesota River Phosphorus Load Reduction","$228,382","Overview
The Middle Minnesota Watershed (MMW) is a major watershed of the Minnesota River Basin.  It covers approximately 862,000 acres across parts of eight counties in south-central Minnesota.  Nicollet County is part of the Middle Minnesota Watershed.  The watershed covers portions of all Nicollet County townships.  In all, about 70% of the land mass within the county is part of the MMW.    

Agriculture is the dominant land use covering 78% of all land in Nicollet County.  Increased farming pressure on the land has caused extensive damage to ravine areas throughout the MMW.  In Nicollet County, almost 70% of the soil being deposited in our streams and rivers is coming from ravines and other near stream features such as stream banks and bluffs.  The remaining soils are carried from crop production lands into the drainage ditches, and into streams/rivers.  Though 70% of soil loss is coming from near stream features, the main source of Phosphorous pollution in our Watershed comes from the 30% of soil lost on our crop production land.

Four cities within the county are located in the Project area.  North Mankato, Saint Peter, Courtland and St. George are situated along the Minnesota River.  Wastewater from North Mankato, Saint Peter and Courtland is treated through a Wastewater Treatment Facility.  St. George has a community treatment system for treating wastewater.    

As of the 2010 303d draft impaired waters list, the MMW within Nicollet County has a total of 18 river/stream reaches with impairments including the Minnesota River main stem and its tributaries. The majority of the listings are for PCBs in fish tissue, bacteria and turbidity. Historical monitoring in Middle Minnesota streams and rivers indicates that there will be many additional impairment listings for nitrate + nitrite nitrogen and phosphorus if/when proposed nutrient standards are established. Additionally, IBI impairment listings are likely following the 2013 Middle Minnesota intensive watershed monitoring.


The desired environmental outcome for this project is to make significant progress in restoring and protecting water quality by helping landowners and farmers implement longer-term adoption and installation of Best Management Practices.  Project activities will be focused to on-the-ground implementation practices that reduce sediment load, phosphate load and peak flow reduction.  By applying significant implementation practices, this project will also increase wildlife habitat and improve aquatic habitat. 

The project will prioritize or target all implementation activities to areas of the Seven Mile Creek Watershed and other tributaries that contribute the largest amount of sediment loading, phosphate loading and peak flows.  Implementation activities will include structural practices to reduce sediment and phosphate loading, open intake removals, and vegetative buffers.  Educational activities will include: vegetative buffer promotion, conservation field days, website updating and a biannual newsletter. 


Objectives
	Install 20 erosion control structures, 20 side inlet control structures on ditches, and installation of buffers around these structures when feasible. 
	Increase the adoption of Best Management Practices that reduce sediment loading, phosphate loading while reducing the peak discharge to the Minnesota River.
	Increase aquatic recreation opportunities in the watershed.
	Continue to foster watershed stewardship and community pride in clean water that achieves a legacy beyond this implementation grant. 
	Install Intake Alternatives (Rock Tile Inlets, Etc.).
	Establish Vegetative Buffers where feasible.


Methods
The Seven Mile Creek inventory study determined ravine and side inlet structures to be contributors to sediment loading to Seven Mile Creek.  Structural practices that control runoff and reduce peak flows will reduce the amount of water and nutrients entering the Middle Minnesota River Watershed. The project will provide up to 75% cost-share in conjunction with other state and federal funding, such as EQIP and State Cost-Share, for structural practices that control runoff. These practices will include: Structure buffers and vegetative treatment areas. Cash match budgeted is from the participating landowners and State Cost-Share.  In-Kind budgeting is from SWCD and other partners.

Vegetative practices slow water flow and cause contaminants like nutrients, sediments, chemicals and bacteria to collect in vegetation. Runoff from fields that have had manure spread on them can be routed through vegetative filters to remove excess sediment, nutrients and bacteria before entering structures.The minimum contract length of 10 years will be required on vegetative buffers on structures. This project will provide operators with an incentive for installing vegetative buffers around structures, equal to CRP rates for up to three years, for the land being buffered.  CRP is typically not an option in these locations.  Therefore, the added benefit of the incentive is a vegetative buffer that would otherwise not likely be installed.   

 The minimum contract length of 10 years will be required on vegetative buffers on structures. This project will provide operators with an incentive for installing vegetative buffers around structures, equal to CRP rates for up to three years, for the land being buffered.  CRP is typically not an option in these locations.  Therefore, the added benefit of the incentive is a vegetative buffer that would otherwise not likely be installed.   The project will provide 75% cost-share up to $320 for the removal of an open tile intake. A landowner is not eligible for this cost-share if they are removing an open intake in one area of their farm and replacing it in another section. The project aims to remove thirty open intakes in the watershed.

The SWCD will publish and distribute a Nicollet SWCD newsletter biannually to all rural watershed residents. These newsletters will include information on BMPs, water quality and project activities as well as other District specific information and NRCS or FSA Program updates. 

The project will use the following promotional items and media to increase the public’s knowledge of the watershed project and what it offers: magnets, fact sheets, brochures, posters, calendars, newspaper articles, etc. The project will actively work with project partners to find additional ways to promote the project.

The Nicollet SWCD has a website and will use the site to maintain and update the progress of the project.   This website can be found at www.nicolletswcd.org. 

SWCD staff and various project partners will promote and explain the project’s goals, activities, cost-share opportunities to area residents at community events, schools and local organizations as opportunities arise. The project will aim to have a presence at the annual Nicollet County fair. The project will also aim to collaborate with schools and local organizations on water quality projects and events.

Workshops, trainings and educational events that project staff may attend on new techniques and studies relating to water quality and water resource management will benefit the success of this project. SWCD staff will also strive to learn valuable lessons and new ideas from other watershed projects.

This component involves the fiscal management and administration of the project, as well as the office support tasks of all objectives.  Budgeted funds will cover staff salary costs to complete administrative tasks.  Grant Cash funds will be used to cover auditing expenses the District will incur.  

The project coordinator will coordinate meetings throughout years 1-4 of the grant.  Staff will seek to network with new groups and landowners in order to spread knowledge about the project and create new partnerships for the future. 

This sub-task will cover all activities related to the engineer/design work of the project and the completion of the project’s goals.  Budgeted funds will cover the salary costs for engineering when completing project design tasks.

SWCD staff will provide technical assistance on surveying and data gathering for projects throughout the MMW.Budgeted funds will cover the salary costs for technician.

This 319 project will develop a water storage calculator linking individual Best Management Practices (BMPs) to large-scale watershed goals.  Enhanced water storage provides benefits through pollutant reduction and peak runoff flow and rate reductions.  The water storage calculator will measure the watershed-scale results for structural and vegetative BMPs.  A water storage learning group incorporating citizen landowners with natural resource professionals will be established to engage in dialog and generate pragmatic input on how to effectively store water in the rural landscape. Water storage BMPs will be tested in the development of the water storage calculator.  Approximately one-third of the project budget will be spent on implementation of new practices and projects.  The water storage calculator and effective BMPs will be demonstrated to technical professionals to help incorporate technology and thinking can into everyday work.

Additional water storage practices will be implemented using non-federal match dollars provided by the Greater Blue Earth River Basin Alliance and the Stearns County Soil and Water Conservation District.  Practices will include both structural and vegetative conversion BMPs ranging from field scale to small watershed scale.  The selection of BMPs will be accomplished solely at the discretion and decisions of local conservation professionals working with their agricultural producers.  The project intends to leverage existing developing projects, but at no time will the public money exceed 75% of the implementation costs.  The list of BMP opportunities currently includes:  perennial vegetation, controlled drainage, offline storage (wetland or detention ponds at a larger scale), and cover crops.  The Water Storage Learning Group may also introduce innovative BMPs to be implemented during this 3-year project.

The goal of this project is to protect the water bodies within the Renville County portion of the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed from elevated nutrient levels, in particular phosphorus.  A major focus of this project will be to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in order to protect waterways of beneficial use and prevent impairments and degradation.  The proposed work area includes those portions of the watersheds of Birch Coulee Creek, Purgatory Creek, Three Mile Creek, Fort Ridgely Creek, and Little Rock Creek that lie within Renville County and also the small areas between those respective watersheds, encompassing a total of 158,320 acres that drain directly to the Minnesota River.  The communities of Morton, Franklin, and Fairfax are located within this priority area, along with several state and county parks, significant State Wildlife Management Areas, rare granite outcrops, several historical landmarks, and several listed rare plant and animal species. 
The primary water quality concern this project addresses is the level of phosphorus threatening the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed.  These water bodies are not listed as impaired for excessive nutrients, but are at heightened risk, primarily due to the high percentage of intensively farmed land.  With a highly manipulated hydrology, large quantities of water move through the watershed at elevated velocities, disrupting the natural stream equilibrium and resulting in substantial streambank erosion and increased loading of sediment and nutrients.  Water bodies in the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed need to be protected in order to maintain their highly-valued beneficial uses, including domestic and industrial consumption, aquatic life and recreation, agricultural and wildlife, and aesthetics and navigation.  According to the draft Minnesota Nutrient Reduction Strategy (2013), the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed is listed at the highest 8 digit hydrologic unit code watershed prioritization level for phosphorus and nitrogen.  Prioritizing BMPs that target cropland runoff and streambank erosion is critical in reducing nutrients in order to achieve the Phase 1 Milestone by 2025 and the overall goals of the Nutrient Reduction Strategy.  The Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed is also modeled as contributing the highest level of total nonpoint source nitrogen to Minnesota’s surface waters, with agricultural lands as a primary source (Nitrogen in MN Surface Waters, MPCA, 2013).  
To address nutrients in surface waters coming from the most common origins of upland sources (eroding soils and runoff from fields, animal feedlots, and urban areas) and near-channel sources (ravines, gullies, bluffs, and streambanks), multi-beneficial, targeted BMPs, such as buffer strips, grassed waterways, grade/gully stabilizations, streambank and shoreline stabilizations, tile intake protection practices, controlled drainage, wetland restorations/protection, and feedlot runoff reduction practices, will be a priority in order to prevent impairments and degradation.  
The Hawk Creek Watershed Project (HCWP) has built strong, long-lasting relationships with collaborating organizations and has a Local Work Group consisting of local, state, and federal agency representatives that meet regularly to prioritize and collaborate on projects.  A substantial amount of expertise exists among the collaborating organizations of this project, including Chippewa, Kandiyohi, and Renville Counties, Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), local water planners, ditch authorities, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, MPCA, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Although many HCWP Local Work Group organizations are not located in the work area of this project, their expertise is still incredibly valuable for implementing projects.  
HCWP also works closely with local landowners, citizens, cities, community leaders, non-profit organizations, schools, and industries to plan and implement BMPs and find holistic strategies to water-related issues.  HCWP has also made public outreach, participation, and education a priority, as it has been shown to increase ownership and leadership in watershed responsibilities, and will hopefully lead to more diverse community involvement in the decision making process of watershed issues to achieve more holistic solutions.     
HCWP is an entity formed through a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) between Chippewa, Kandiyohi, and Renville Counties.  The Board of Directors is made up of one County Commissioner from each of the JPA counties.

Methods
1.	The primary outcome of this project will be to work with five local landowners to implement BMPs that focus on protection of the Renville County portion of the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed from elevated nutrient levels, in particular phosphorus.  BMPs with multiple benefits, such as improving water quality, habitat, and hydrology, will be a priority.  BMP pollutant reductions will be calculated and tracked by eLINK to measure the effectiveness of BMPs and progress of work done in critical areas.  Based on past project pollutant reductions, the estimated pollutant reductions through this grant are 680 pounds of phosphorus per year and 255 tons of sediment per year.  By addressing the sources of pollutant contamination, this project will help protect the Minnesota River – Mankato Watershed and remediate the water quality impairments of the Minnesota River.  Long-term water quality monitoring of the Minnesota River by MPCA will be used to determine if improvements are being realized.                    
2.	This project will provide an important framework for citizen involvement, which will contribute to long-term public participation in water quality awareness and stewardship.  This project will provide for outreach and education activities meant to create conversations, build collaboration, and strengthen community involvement in water quality issues.  An estimated 3,279 mailings are projected to be distributed to households within the watershed.

The project is located within the North Fork Coeur d'Alene River Subbasin in Upper Tepee Creek, specifically within the Short Creek and Riley Creek watersheds. It is a collaborative effort between the North Idaho Flycasters and the U.S. Forest Service in consultation with IDEQ and the Watershed Advisory Group. The Short-Riley Creeks Porter Memorial Restoration Project has a two year project plan developed. It is located on lands managed by the
USDA Forest Service, where the Forest Service plans in the first year to decommission roads, conduct instream
restoration measures, and remove culvert crossings. In the second year we will remove and properly replace a known
fish passage barrier. The purpose of this project is to improve water quality by removing high risk stream crossings on unutilized road systems, reduce sediment entrainment, improve instream fisheries and aquatic habitat, and remove and replace fish passage barriers, providing fish access to cooler streams for thermal refugia. The road decommissioning work will remove high risk crossings on road ways that are not utilized under current or future management goals, these roads range from primarily heavily brushed in and abandoned to partially drivable. The instream restoration work is designed to reestablish a flood plain and create a new channel shape that mimics a more functional stream course. Habitat and gradient control structures would be installed in the approximate 1-mile reach of Short Creek to prevent high
flow degradation. These structures would be constructed from large logs brought onto the site and naturally occurring wood and boulders. The instream structures will be designed to help control water velocity and the erosive energy that occurs during peak flows, while creating more diverse aquatic habitat. Replacement of stream crossings on main travel routes will allow for fish and aquatic organism passage into the watersheds during critical migration and thermal stress periods for spawning and rearing. An important element in the implementation of this project would be the collaborative role that we, the North Idaho Fly Casters, support through our conservation goals. In the last 25-years we have assisted in monetary, volunteer, and stewardship conservation goals within the Coeur d'Alene River watershed. We recognize this outcome as a win-win for all, especially the improvement of overall watershed health. In our efforts we have received the USDA Forest Service Chiefs Volunteers National Program Award (2002 and 2006) and conservation awards from the
FFF, due to the many projects we have coordinated on in the past. Outcomes and Benefits - Primarily to reduce
sediment entrainment, this will improve the quality of cold water aquatic life by implementing stewardship objectives that enhance watershed ecosystems. Through restoration and improvement of the land's health and water quality, such aproject would encompass a broad-based collaboration with objectives that may include, but are not limited to: a) Road decommissioning; b) Soil decompaction and productivity improvement; c) Improvements in watershed ecosystem health; d) Watershed restoration and maintenance; e) Restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife and fish habitat; f) Water temperature and riparian shade goal attainment; g) Reestablishment of fish passage for native species.

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields


Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) base funding will be used to support the Nutrient Management Program Manager and the Nutrient Management Training and Certification Coordinator, both based in the DCR, DSWC central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 Nutrient Management Specialists. Two full-time and one part-time nutrient management specialists will be housed in agency watershed field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement Objectives 1, 2, and 5 of the Agriculture Chapter in the Virginia Nonpoint Source Pollution Management Program Plan. .  In addition this project implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan.

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), in conjunction with the Tri-County Community Action Agency Inc., proposes to fund over two years (Nov. 2013 – Dec. 2015) of TMDL implementation project to reduce fecal coliform impairments in Banister River, Sandy Creek, and Polecat Creek through implementation of residential septic and pet waste best management practices in accordance with a previously published and approved TMDL Implementation Plan. This project will provide funding for education and outreach and technical assistance to develop BMPs for installation. Use of Section 319(h) incremental funds is appropriate as the approved IP met EPA’s A-I conditions for watershed plans.

Objectives
To implement on-the-ground BMP activities through TMDL watershed implementation plans that result in the reduction of nutrients, bacteria and sediment in runoff, increased water quality, restoration of waterbodies and ultimate delisting of impaired stream segments.

Methods
The implementation goals are as follows for Residential Septic BMPs in Polecat Creek, Sandy Creek, and the Lower Banister River:
•Septic tank pumpout (RB-1) = 			40
•Septic system repair (RB-3) = 			13
•Septic system replacement (RB-4/RB-4P) = 	         19
•Alternative waste treatment system (RB-5) = 	1

For the pet waste management portion of the project, a minimum of three (3) Educational and/or informational programs will be developed for this effort. Possible activities may include purchase and distribution of pet waste bag dispensers, distribution of pet waste management information at civil or community events, distribution of literature through local veterinarian offices, kennels, or humane societies, or public outreach through newspaper ads, public service announcements, or posters displayed throughout the watershed.
BMP’s will include the distribution of pet waste digester units to participating residential pet owners within the drainage basin. Owners will be asked to use the digester units for a period of two years and to complete a survey at the end of that period evaluating the usage and convenience of the systems. Pet waste stations will also be installed at manageable locations within the implementation area for use by residents. Additionally, an on-site waste treatment system will be installed at one location for a veterinarian office (confined canine unit) that has expressed interest in participating in the program.

Goal: To work as a team member in a regional setting and within the Division of Soil and Water Conservation to provide professional assistance to Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) to achieve mutual goals and improve water quality. To provide leadership and program direct to SWCDs and to implement DSWC nonpoint source reduction programs through SWCDs within the region. 

Introduction: This project will provide funding to support three fulltime (FTE) DCR employees to serve as Conservation District Coordinators in three regional offices throughout Virginia (Abingdon, Christiansburg and Suffolk) to provide leadership and technical assistance to Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs). Soil and water conservation districts (SWCDs) were established in the 1930s to develop comprehensive programs and plans to conserve soil resources, control and prevent soil erosion, prevent floods and conserve, develop, utilize and dispose water. Today, forty-seven districts serve as local resources for citizens in nearly all Virginia localities.

The ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program will be modeled from coastal programs that work to reduce the amount of nonpoint source pollution entering into coastal waterways from marina operations.  This concept will be used to create a pilot program focused on lakes within the Upper White River Basin watershed with emphasis on Table Rock Lake.  This program will give marina owners the opportunity to take action in a voluntary program that reduces their impact on water quality while educating boaters and the community of their stewardship efforts.  The goal is to enroll at least ten marinas and use this pilot program as a catalyst in making the “Missouri Clean Marina” program a statewide initiative. 

Objectives
Project Objective:  The ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program will give marina owners the opportunity to take action in a voluntary program that reduces their impact on water quality while educating boaters and the community of their stewardship efforts.
The main objectives of this program are:
1.	Develop a ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program that marinas can join to act as part of a voluntary, self-regulating effort to reduce nonpoint source pollution.
2.	Develop ""Missouri Clean Marina"" requirements that when implemented at participating marinas educate boaters, patrons, and community on nonpoint source issues and reduce the impact of potential nonpoint source pollution.

Methods
A ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program will be developed and will include the following publications to be disseminated to all marinas within the Upper White River Basin watershed: 
   Promotional educational brochure/pamphlet about the ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program
   ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program application for each participating marina
   ""Missouri Clean Marina"" guidebook
   ""Missouri Clean Marina"" checklist
   ""Missouri Clean Marina"" pledge
   ""Missouri Clean Marina"" renewal form
Three Advisory Committee meetings 
Minimum of 10 marinas will be enrolled in the ""Missouri Clean Marina"" program
3,000 boaters and marina patrons will gain increased awareness of nonpoint source issues
General public will gain increased knowledge of nonpoint source issues with media coverage and website regarding program.  Media coverage will be obtained through press releases to reach an approx. viewership/readership of 100,000

The plan will outline goals and identify actions for surface waters within the watershed that do not meet water quality standards. Stakeholders from local governments, individual property owners, and representatives from community organizations will be involved throughout the planning process (Figure 3 attachment - Timeline). Project objectives include:
1) Stakeholder Involvement- Ozarks Water Watch (OWW) will form and manage a technical advisory committee. OWW will plan and lead several stakeholder meetings to develop interest in the project and to gain public input. Public concerns about water quality will be surveyed.
2) NPS modeling- The Ozarks Environmental and Water Resources Institute (OEWRI) at Missouri State University will use STEP-L modeling to: (i) assess NPS loads from sub-watershed areas, (ii) target effective BMPs, and (iii) estimate load reductions for different BMP scenarios.

This project will greatly improve the water quality of local streams by constructing riparian buffers
along 6 miles of streams and through direct seed cost share programs. The districts will increase the
use of direct seed systems by 9,600 acres and reduce soil erosion by 42,000 tons.

Objectives
The goal of this project is to implement agricultural water quality BMPs needed to meet water quality
standards in the Palouse River watershed. In addition, the project will evaluate the perceptions of
these practices among Palouse watershed farmers and collect monitoring data is to evaluate the
effectiveness of the BMP implementation .
The Palouse River, Pleasant Valley, and Rebel Flat Creeks all fail water quality parameters and are
listed on as Category 5 water bodies in the Washington State Water Quality Assessment. Rock Creek
is also described as a a ""water of concern."" Water quality monioring data indicates that the rivers and
streams in the Palouse Watershed are impaired by various pollutants resulting in water quality
problems that include:
Low dissolved oxygen levels
pH outside the range required by aquatic organisms
High water temperatures
High fecal coliform bacteria levels
The department of Ecology has completed the Palouse River Fecal (2010) TMDL working on bacteria,
temperature and dissolved oxygen/pH TMDLs within the watershed to address the water qualityproblems. These Palouse River TMDL's have indicated and identified that Direct Seed farming systems can reduce soil erosion by 95% thus improving water quality. The TMDL further states the need for riparian buffers along rivers and streams which will improve water quality by improving temperature parameters, dissolve oxygen, ph, decreasing sedimentation, nutrient loading and fecal colifom in water.

Methods
Utilizing the direct seed cost share programs, utilizing outreach and edcuationa we will increase direct seed arerage and improve water quality in the two districts.
A. The Palouse Rock Lake CD has had exceptional success promoting the increase of Direct Seed farming systems in the district utilizing the Direct Seed Outreach Education, Direct Seed Cost Share and the Pine Creek and PRLCD BMP Partnership grants. These grants have enabled the PRLCD district to increase usage of direct seed in the district to over 50 % which will decrease soil erosion by 95%. These grants will also demonstrate
B. Develop site specific riparian protection plans and landowner agreements for each riparian buffer project to ensure the project will adequately protect water quality and will be consistent with NRCS and Ecology riparian buffer standards. Have the Ecology project manager approve plans before implementation.
D. When landowners have creeks, streams and rivers adjacent to program lands they will have appropriate buffers along the streams.
E. Establish some riparian buffers on the streams in locations where direct seed systems will be used in the upland areas. Using riparian buffers in conjunction with Direct Seed practices will work in unison to improve water quality by maximizing conservation efforts.","Y","Project Implementation","17060107","170601070205","N","10/01/2014",NA,"<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:97696"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)",50000
"441","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has provided subwatershed (12-digit HUC) scale data for the state of Arkansas which indicate, on an average, threefold increase in the number of watersheds compared to 10-digit HUC level data.  Geomorphologic resolution of subwatersheds has been reported to dramatically affect the SWAT modeled runoff flow, sediment and nutrient outputs (Bingner et al.,1997; Mamillapalli, 1998; FitzHugh and MacKay,2000; Jha et al. ,2004; and Arabi et al., 2006).  Therefore model outputs will be constrained to 12-digit HUC boundaries in order to avoid errors due to scale issues.  During the first phase of modeling project conducted during 2008-2010, we used the latest release of SWAT model (SWAT2009) and available data to prioritize 12-digit subwatersheds for four 8-digit HUC priority watersheds namely, Illinois River Drainage Area in Arkansas (IRDAA), Beaver Reservoir (BR), Lake Conway Point Remove (LCPR) and Bayou Bartholomew (BR).  The study resulted in identifying prioritized watersheds based on their contribution of nonpoint sources at 12-digit HUC scale (Project # 08-300; Pai et al., 2011).  The ranking was developed using percentile scale with those falling in the 80-100th percentile being designated as priority subwatershed.  We propose to generate similarly ranked subwatershed for two 8-digit priority watersheds i.e. Cache River, and Lower Ouachita-Smackover.  This information about prioritized subwatersheds will help ANRC in making further management decisions.

Objectives
This project will calibrate and validate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model at locations with available flow and water quality data so that subwatersheds within the 8-digit HUCs of Cache River, and Lower Ouachita-Smackover watershed are assessed and ranked based on their contribution to non point source (NPS) pollution.  The project will monitor water quality and enter the required data into the WQX or STORET database. A qualitative comparison of one year long monitoring data with the model output at the 12-digit HUC level will be performed.  The impact of land use change on water quality shall be modeled for Cache river watershed to predict long term impact of Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP).

The water quality issues faced in the Bull Creek and Cedar Creek watersheds largely result from agricultural activities throughout the watershed, including row-cropping, livestock operations, and improper storage and land application of poultry waste.  Both are listed in the 2004 Georgia Section 305(b) Report and Section 303(d) Lists of “Rivers and Streams not supporting designated uses.”  The designated use is fishing. The criteria violated are dissolved oxygen (DO) and Fecal Coliform for Cedar Creek and DO for Bull Creek. Agriculture is a significant land use in both impaired watersheds, comprising 48% of the land area in the Cedar Creek Watershed and 40% of the Bull Creek Watershed.  The stormwater runoff from these activities carries sediment, animal waste, and excess nutrients from the land into adjacent streams increasing the biological oxygen demand and lowering dissolved oxygen levels. The poultry and cattle waste entering Cedar Creek directly increases its Fecal Coliform counts. According to the local NRCS District Conservationist, few agricultural operations in the project area are using applicable BMPs such as conservation tillage, cattle stream exclusion, nutrient management, or stackhouses (covered storage facilities for dry poultry litter).  

The total row crop, pasture and hayland area in these two watersheds is 37,842 acres.  Annually tilled cropland is a major source of sediment and nutrient pollutants in the project area because it leaves the soil surface exposed to the erosive impact of rain for prolonged periods. A package of proven conservation measures such as those to be installed in this project can reduce erosion from farm fields by over 90%.  

Animal waste is another major agricultural conservation concern in both the Cedar Creek and Bull Creek watersheds. In NRCS data quoted in EPD’s TMDL Evaluation for the Ogeechee River issued in January 2005 Tattnall County has 13,200 head of beef cattle and 8,892,000 chickens. Evans County has 4920 beef cattle and 1,540,000 chickens. An individual beef animal can be expected to produce about 60 pounds of waste each day, containing 0.34 lbs of Nitrogen (N), 0.25 lbs. of Phosphorus (P) and 0.29 lbs. of Potassium (K). So the total production of waste from beef cattle in the two counties is about 198,414 tons/year. This waste contains 2,248,692 pounds of Nitrogen (N), 1,653,450 pounds of Phosphorus (P), and 1,918,002 pounds of Potassium (K).

1000 broiler chickens excrete about 140 pounds of waste each day, which contains about 2.4 lbs. of Nitrogen (N), 1.23 lbs. of Phosphorus (P) and 0.90 lbs. of Potassium (K). Therefore, the total production of waste from chickens in the two counties is about 266,538 tons/year. Included in this waste is 9,138,432 pounds of Nitrogen (N), 4,683,446 pounds of Phosphorus (P), and 3,426,912 pounds of Potassium (K). The large amounts of animal waste and related nutrients produced in the two counties indicate the potential cause of the DO and Fecal Coliform levels which EPD found to violate EPA standards in its 2002 monitoring program. These poultry operations provide inexpensive fertilizer to farmers in these watersheds. Unfortunately, few farmers using this poultry litter apply it according to a nutrient management plan or use a calibrated spreader to ensure the proper amount and timing of litter application.   This can lead to excess nutrients applied and readily carried to streams by stormwater.

Georgia EPD submitted a TMDL Evaluation to USEPA for 23 Stream segments in the Ogeechee River Basin for Dissolved Oxygen and for 21 Stream segments for Fecal Coliform in January 2005. Segments of Cedar Creek were included in both TMDL Evaluations; Bull Creek was one of the impaired segments in the Dissolved Oxygen Evaluation. Included in each Evaluation were Initial TMDL Implementation Plans. Each TMDL plan includes a Management Measure Selector Table. Under Agriculture, the management measures designated as appropriate for both Dissolved Oxygen and Fecal Coliform reduction include Sediment & Erosion Control, Confined Animal Facilities, Nutrient Management, and Livestock Grazing. Implementing BMPs to address these Management Measures is the central focus of this project. 

This project implements the Agricultural components of the Initial TMDL Implementation Plans for both DO and FC in Cedar Creek and DO in Bull Creek. The Executive Summary of the TMDL Evaluation for Fecal Coliform summarizes its Initial TMDL Implementation Plan as follows: “Management practices that may be used to help reduce fecal coliform source loads include… Adoption of NRCS Conservation Practices and Application of Best Management Practices (BMPs) appropriate to reduce nonpoint sources. The amount of fecal coliform delivered to a stream is difficult to determine. However, by requiring and monitoring the implementation of these management practices, their effects will improve stream water quality, and represent a beneficial measure of TMDL implementation.” The Executive Summary for the Dissolved Oxygen TMDL Implementation Plan includes similar language. 


Objectives
The objective of this project is to improve the water quality within the Cedar Creek and Bull Creek watersheds by assisting in the implementation of TMDL plans for Dissolved Oxygen and Fecal Coliform. This will be accomplished by utilizing both structural and non-structural BMPs coupled with educational outreach efforts to ensure water quality restoration and protection. This project will address nonpoint sources of pollution from cropland, pastureland, beef cattle and poultry operations. 

Methods
Project activities are comprised of three major components: 
·	Project Development 
·	BMP Implementation 
·	Educational Outreach


Project Development

The Coastal Georgia RC&D Council will execute a contract with GAEPD for the Section 319(h) Grant.  The Council will review all conservation plans prepared by NRCS and coordinate BMP planning and installation with NRCS staff.  The Council will request payments from GAEPD and transfer those funds to participating landowners once BMP certification has been provided by NRCS and payments have been received from GAEPD.  The Council will assist the Ogeechee River SWCD in organizing a BMP Demonstration Field Day, in cooperation with NRCS and the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC).  The Council will track all grant funds expended and all match values provided by participating landowners, as well as state and district personnel.  The Council will complete and submit semi-annual progress reports to GAEPD by February 28 and August 31 of each project year.  The Council will also conduct an annual audit of its operations and provide a copy to the State Auditor and GAEPD as mandated by the Governor’s 1998 Executive Order.  

The Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission and the Ogeechee River Soil and Water Conservation District will assist in getting BMP information to local landowners. The District will receive regular progress reports on the project at their regular monthly meetings and will help guide the project as it progresses.  These agencies will review landowner applications and help select those that will have the most TMDL impact. The District will also plan and organize the BMP Demonstration Field Day with assistance from NRCS, GSWCC and RC&D Council staff.  The District will promote the use of conservation tillage equipment already deployed in the watershed by the District and the Council.  The District will also set funding limits for individual landowners in order to maximize the number of participants.  

NRCS staff will assist the District with locating and selecting project sites.  Working with the landowners, NRCS will design appropriate BMPs and certify their installation, as well as provide conservation plans and cost estimates for Council review.   NRCS will submit requests for payment along with all supporting documentation from the landowners for Council review, and assist the District with planning and executing the BMP Demonstration Field Day.  

BMP Implementation

Local NRCS staff will work directly with landowners to implement their BMPs by:  

·	Selecting appropriate BMPs for each site.
·	Producing BMP designs that are site-specific.
·	Developing conservation plans in cooperation with landowners.
·	Inspecting installed BMPs and certifying that they meet NRCS standards and specifications.
·	Completing requests for cost-share payments to landowners once BMPs have been installed and certified.

The implemented BMPs will include both structural and non-structural practices.  Each structural or non-structural practice will be certified individually as meeting established USDA-NRCS standards and specifications.  Each BMPs effectiveness will be quantified by NRCS staff using NRCS’s Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) for erosion BMPs and NRCS’ Agricultural Water Quality Watershed Assessment (AWQWA) for animal waste BMPs.

Educational Outreach

The Educational Outreach component of the project consists of a locally publicized BMP Demonstration Field Day that will be held after the initial BMP installations have been completed.  The purpose of this event is to educate local landowners about the benefits and cost savings provided by the BMPs.  The aim of this outreach effort is to encourage additional cost-share applications and increased voluntary use of BMPs by other producers in the watershed.

Rum Creek is located in the 10‐digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 0307010313. Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) conducted stream monitoring in the Ocmulgee River basin in 2004. Based on the monitoring results, Rum Creek upstream of Lake Juliette was placed on the State’s 2006 impaired stream list for fecal coliform. In 2007, GADNR prepared a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for this stream segment. Total Maximum Daily Load refers to the total amount of a particular pollutant that can be discharged into a waterway per day without the waterway violating the state’s water quality standards. The TMDL Implementation Plan was developed when Rum Creek was found to exceed the allowable amount of fecal bacteria and was identified by the State of Georgia on the Section 305(b)/303(d) list of impaired waters not supporting designated uses.

TMDL Implementation Plans were intended to outline the programs and timetables necessary to bring listed waterways into compliance with established water quality standards. The Rum Creek TMDL Implementation Plan’s ultimate goals was to achieve the TMDL for fecal coliform (FC) and restore the waterway’s designated use of fishing.

Objectives
•Completing a Watershed Management Plan using Nine Minimum elements of watershed planning. 
•Obtaining baseline water quality data in the watershed to assist in monitoring improvements during future Watershed Management Plan implementation.
•Coordinating water quality improvement efforts in the watershed to acquire a greater participation in alternative funding opportunities.
•Assisting with expanding and organizing Adopt-a- Stream Groups to be used for monitoring.
•Providing public education on water quality and practical solutions to restore and protect the waters of our region.

The primary goal of the restoration project along the Jordan River is to enhance the water quality and restore stream bank stability of the Jordan River at 8600 South and 9000 South respectively. According to the Jordan River Bank Restoration Project Environmental Assessment (EA) that was performed in 1996, of the 22 river miles between the south Salt Lake County line and 2100 South Street, approximately 15 miles have been adversely impacted by historic hydrologic modifications. Furthermore, many portions of the bank of the Jordan River at the proposed ecosystem restoration site are mass wasting (Figures 1 to 4). It is estimated that Site 12A, location of the proposed ecosystem restoration, there is appoximately 3500 tons of sediment deposited into the Jordan River each year. This has resulted in excessive sedimentation to the river environment, depleted fish habitat, and destruction of riparian habitat.

Objectives
The goal and objective of the restoration and grade control project is eliminate 100% of the mass wasting of the banks of the Jordan River where the restoration is to occur and reduce the sediment load being released into the Jordan River to zero.

Methods
The methods used to obtain the goals and objectives is to construct grade control structures along site 12 and ecosystem restoration along site 12A as per the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Ecosystem Restoration Project narratives from 2000 and 2002 (See Appendix C for design drawings and Appendix A for map of site locations).  After physical alteration of the stream at sites 12 and 12A, use broadcast seeding and tree plantings to establish a diverse vegetation community. This is anticipated to reduce the sediment load from the banks of the Jordan River where the restoration is to occur indefinitely.","Y","Project Implementation","16020204","160202040403","N","10/01/2009","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:48220"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation, Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)",24561

The Waconda Watershed is a large watershed covering 3,272,675 acres, or roughly 5,144 square miles.   Primarily an agricultural area, cropland comprises 49% of land cover within the watershed.  Grassland and pasture account for another 44% of the land use in the watershed, and the remaining 7% is accounted for through small urban areas (4%), surface water, wetlands, and woodlands.  The large economic reliance on agriculture and livestock within the watershed places a large ecologic burden on the Waconda Watershed's streams and rivers.  Issues such as overgrazing, allowing cattle access to streams, improper fertilizer application, and large feedlots degrade the water quality within the watershed.   

In 2006 and 2007, the Solomon Valley RC&D Area, Inc. used 319 monies to initiate a WRAPS Development Phase.  The primary accomplishments of this phase were: 
1.  Organization of a Stakeholder Leadership Team 
2.  Information and Education activities that helped introduce issues of water quality to the residents of the watershed 
3.  Compilation of water quality concerns of watershed residents 

With the completion of the development phase, the Solomon Valley RC&D Area, Inc. is now ready to assess the conditions of the watershed more closely in order to determine primary sources/causes of non-point source pollution.  The information gathered during assessment activities will be used to target areas most in need of best management practices and to plan for how to implement and fund these BMPs.


Objectives
The goal of this assessment and planning phase is to characterize watershed conditions, identify needs and opportunities, and understand how the watershed responds to various management scenarios.  The assessment activities will facilitate the preparation of a document that identifies actions necessary to achieve stakeholder-established watershed goals.

The Waconda Reservoir WRAPS began work developing their WRAPS project in June 2006.  In December 2006 public meetings were held in Colby, Hill City, Lenora and Osborne to allow the public to voice issues and concerns dealing with water in the watershed. After the meetings, a full list of issues and concerns was compiled and surveys were mailed to those who attended the meetings to rank their top concerns.  

Using meeting information and survey results, the SLT met in April 2007 and determined the following top six watershed concerns.

1. Water use efficiency

2. Chemical and fertilizer use.

3. Livestock and pet waste

4. Illegal dumping of trash

5. Household hazardous waste

6. General Education

 
The #1 concern of water use efficiency cannot be addressed by 319 funds.

 
A Rapid Watershed Assessment was conducted by Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Kansas State Research and Extension, and Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and the Environment (KCARE).   The report for this assessment was released in December 2007.  Impairments identified include: Sulfate, Selenium, Biology, E. Coli Bacteria, Dissolved Oxygen, and Euthrophication.  

 In July 2008, the Assessment and Planning Phase of the Waconda WRAPS project began.  Because of the large area the Waconda Lake watershed encompasses it was decided to focus Assessment efforts on the area above Waconda Lake and below Kirwin Lake and Webster Lake.

In November 2009, Kansas Alliance for Wetlands and Streams (KAWS) was hired by the SLT to conduct an assessment of Streambank Erosion Sites for 2 HUC 14s within the watershed.  Areas of concern were identified.

KDHE released revised TMDLs in September 2010, for areas of concern within the Waconda watershed.  

At the November 2010 SLT meeting it was determined that there was sufficient enough data to show justification for additional assessment and planning for the watershed above Kirwin Lake.  The portion of the Waconda watershed above and including Kirwin Lake has been designated a separate WRAPS project and thus will begin the process of developing a 9 Element plan specific to that area.

Objectives
The Waconda WRAPS SLT will provide assistance to stakeholders within the identified Cropland Priority Areas and the Bacteria Priority Areas to decrease the amount of nutrients entering the riparian areas of the watershed of the Waconda Reservoir.

The Waconda WRAPS SLT will inform and educate area citizens and producers of how BMPs can improve water quality by decreasing nutrient loading.

Methods
Cropland BMPs noted for implementation within Year 1 of the Waconda Lake Watershed Plan:

*1,152 acres of cropland treated with waterways
*1,152 acres of cropland treated with terraces/terrace rebuilds
*1,152 acres of cropland converted to no-till
*346 acres of cropland treated with riparian buffers.

Cropland BMPs projected to be implemented from this grant include the following:

*317 acres of terrace rebuilds

Livestock BMPs noted for implementation within Year 1 of the Waconda Lake Watershed Plan:

*728 acres of rotational grazing
*527 acres of brush management
*5 alternative watering supplies
*55 acres of critical area planting

Livestock BMPs projected to be implemented from this grant include the following:

*3 alternative watering supplies

The $45,000 provided through this grant for costshare to implement conservation practices will be divided as follows:

*$2,000 for demonstration project to pay the producer's share of an alternative watering supply
*$5,000 for cost share for livestock BMPs resulting in installation of 2 alternative watering supplies
*$38,000 for cost share on rebuilding of failing terraces which will result in an estimated treatment of 317 acres of cropland 

One demonstration project will be held between August 1, 2011 and July 31, 2012.  The demonstration project will be Riparian Area Exclusion and could utilize, but will not be limited to, alternative water supplies, water pipelines, solar pumps, and fencing for livestock exclusion.  The project will be located within the Bacteria Priority Area and will be determined by practice need and producer willingness.

The portion of the Waconda watershed above and including Kirwin Lake was designated a separate WRAPS project and has completed a 9 Element plan specific to that area.

The Waconda Lake WRAPS Plan was approved by KDHE on November 30, 2011.  The first year of Implementation for Waconda WRAPS was Fiscal Year 2012. The project started August 2011 and was completed December 2012. During this first year of Implementation the need for cost-share to install practices was evident by the number of applications received during a very short application period. It was announced in local newspapers the week of May 10, 2012 that applications would be accepted from May 17 to May 31, 2012. During this two-week period 36 applications were received requesting cost-share for 49.42 acres of grassed waterways, 109,387 linear ft. of terraces, 500 linear ft. of underground outlet, and 1 alternative watering site. Using the WRAPS funds in the most beneficial way possible, the project was able to fund 16.92 acres of grassed waterways, 55,637 linear ft. of terrace, 500 linear ft. of underground outlet, and the one alternative watering site.
This left 32.5 acres of grassed waterways and 53,250 linear ft of terrace unfunded and unable to be implemented. To fund all of the project applications at the same rate of cost-share, an additional $46,366 would have been needed.
The FY 2012 Waconda WRAPS Implementation project provided phosphorus load reductions as follows. The 16.92 acres of grassed waterways provide an annual phosphorus load reduction of 18.61 lbs. The 55,637 linear ft. of terraces translates to 278.19 contributing acres which provide an annual phosphorus load reduction of 183.60 lbs. The 500 linear ft. of underground outlet translates to 2.5 contributing acres with an annual phosphorus load reduction of 1.65 lbs. The one project to provide an alternative watering site provides an annual phosphorous load reduction of 146 lbs. The BMPs implemented for FY 2012 for
the Waconda WRAPS project provided a total of 349.86 lbs of annual phosphorus load reduction which is 6.4% of the total annual phosphorus load reduction goal of 5,472 lbs.

Objectives
Reduce phosphorous levels in Waconda Lake

Reduce bacteria runoff from livestock operations.

Increase awareness of water quality issues with information and education activities.

Methods
Implement cropland (grassed waterways) and livestock (alternative water systems) BMPs in the Priority Areas that are identified by the Waconda Lake WRAPS Plan for year 2014. Reach the annual phosphorous load reduction goal 5,472 lbs. through contribution of:
1,948 lbs. in the Cropland High Priority Area
1,522 lbs. in the Cropland Med.-High Priority Area.

Implement livestock (alternative water systems) BMPs in the Priority Areas that are identified by the Waconda Lake WRAPS Plan for year 2014. This area includes Cedar Creek, Beaver Creek and Deer Creek in the Lower North Fork of the Solomon River and a majority
of the Lower South Fork of the Solomon River and supporting tributaries/riparian areas.
1,223 lbs. in the Bacteria Priority Area of the Lower South Fork of the Solomon River
779 lbs. in the Bacteria Priority Area of the Lower North Fork of the Solomon River

Using the WRAPS funds in the most beneficial way possible, the project was able to fund 16.92 acres of grassed waterways, 55,637 linear ft. of terrace, 500 linear ft. of underground outlet, and the one alternative watering site.
This left 32.5 acres of grassed waterways and 53,250 linear ft of terrace unfunded and unable to be implemented. To fund all of the project applications at the same rate of cost-share, an additional $46,366 would have been needed.
The FY 2012 Waconda WRAPS Implementation project provided phosphorus load reductions as follows. The 16.92 acres of grassed waterways provide an annual phosphorus load reduction of 18.61 lbs. The 55,637 linear ft. of terraces translates to 278.19 contributing acres which provide an annual phosphorus load reduction of 183.60 lbs. The 500 linear ft. of underground outlet translates to 2.5 contributing acres with an annual phosphorus load reduction of 1.65 lbs. The one project to provide an alternative watering site provides an annual phosphorous load reduction of 146 lbs. The BMPs implemented for FY 2012 for
the Waconda WRAPS project provided a total of 349.86 lbs of annual phosphorus load reduction which is 6.4% of the total annual phosphorus load reduction goal of 5,472 lbs.

The Waconda Lake WRAPS began work developing their WRAPS project in June 2006. In December 2006, public meetings were held in Colby, Hill City, Lenora and Osborne to allow the public to voice issues and concerns dealing with water in the watershed. After the meetings, a full list of issues and concerns was compiled and surveys were mailed to those who attended
the meetings to rank their top concerns.

Using meeting information and survey results, the SLT met in April 2007 and determined the following top six watershed concerns.
1. Water use efficiency
2. Chemical and fertilizer use.
3. Livestock and pet waste
4. Illegal dumping of trash
5. Household hazardous waste
6. General Education
The #1 concern of water use efficiency cannot be addressed by 319 funds.

A Rapid Watershed Assessment was conducted by Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Kansas State Research and Extension, and Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and the Environment (KCARE) . The report for this assessment was released in December 2007. Impairments identified include: Sulfate, Selenium, Biology, E. Coli Bacteria, Dissolved Oxygen, and Euthrophication.

In July 2008, the Assessment and Planning Phase of the Waconda WRAPS project began. Because of the large area the Waconda Lake watershed encompasses it was decided to focus Assessment efforts on the area above Waconda Lake and below Kirwin Lake and Webster Lake.

In November 2009, Kansas Alliance for Wetlands and Streams (KAWS) was hired by the SLT to conduct an assessment of Streambank Erosion Sites for 2 HUC 14s within the watershed. Areas of concern were identified.

KDHE released revised TMDLs in September 2010, for areas of concern within the Waconda watershed.

At the November 2010 SLT meeting it was determined that there was sufficient data to show justification for additional assessment and planning for the watershed above Kirwin Lake. The portion of the Waconda watershed above and including Kirwin Lake was designated a separate WRAPS project and has completed a 9 Element plan specific to that area.

The Waconda Lake WRAPS Plan was approved by KDHE on November 30, 2011.  The first year of Implementation for Waconda WRAPS was Fiscal Year 2012. The project started August 2011 and was completed December 2012. During this first year of Implementation the need for cost-share to install practices was evident by the number of applications received during a very short application period. It was announced in local newspapers the week of May 10, 2012 that applications would be accepted from May 17 to May 31, 2012. During this two-week period 36 applications were received requesting cost-share for 49.42 acres of grassed waterways, 109,387 linear ft. of terraces, 500 linear ft. of underground outlet, and 1 alternative watering site. Using the WRAPS funds in the most beneficial way possible, the project was able to fund 16.92 acres of grassed waterways, 55,637 linear ft. of terrace, 500 linear ft. of underground outlet, and the one alternative watering site.
This left 32.5 acres of grassed waterways and 53,250 linear ft of terrace unfunded and unable to be implemented. To fund all of the project applications at the same rate of cost-share, an additional $46,366 would have been needed.

Activities to be reported will include the number of landowner contacts, the number of projects and the number of acres for which they have provided information, planning, ranking, assistance and / or project support to landowners and staff for the conservation programs and / or practices related to buffers, CRP and conservation (i.e. WRP) easements:



Objectives
Goal: The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Department of Agriculture's Division of Conservation (DOC) provide technical assistance to Kansas landowners to implement BMPs. Kansas WRAPS projects are focused on BMP implementation in areas with TMDLs/303d listed waters to delist water quality impairments.    An already demanding workload for BMP implementation technical assistance and the addition of WRAPS projects providing increased funding opportunities in high workload areas has led to the need for increased personnel support to the DOC to fund design technicians so that the conservation and BMP implementation efforts of WRAPS, NRCS and DOC will be accomplished.




Objective: Provide increased technical assistance in high workload areas by utilizing the Technical Assistance Partnership process to increase technical assistance. 

Approximately 26 NRCS practices through EQIP, WHIP, CRP,WRP,SIP, WRAPS and other federal and state financial assistance programs will be provided technical support for implementation as needed.




Conservation Technicians willreport the flowing information to DOC, KDWPT, and NRCS: State cost-share, Type ofcontract or application, Planning, Ranking, Assistance, Project Support,Training, Other pertinent items and Total hours along with State ContractNumber (if known or applicable) and Total State Project Cost.  Design, staking, and other technical assistance will be provided in order to implement the above conservation practice programs.

Goal: Accomplish Significant pollutant load reductions through increased technical support for BMP implementation.

Goal: Technical assistance and implementation support of the Commonwealth’s programs dealing with erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, streambank and shoreline erosion control to limit nutrients and sediment in runoff from urban lands.  

Introduction: The Virginia Stormwater Management Act of 2004, consolidated Virginia's stormwater management programs within the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and transferred oversight responsibilities to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board from the Board of Conservation and Recreation. This legislation has had a significant impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s stormwater management capability.  

Description: DCR staff will provide technical guidance and advice to local governments, state and federal land management agencies, environmental regulatory agencies, community groups, watershed management planners and private citizens. Technical staff will assist in comprehensive local program reviews of erosion and sediment control and urban stormwater management programs in order to note and correct deficiencies. Staff will also provide comprehensive watershed planning advice and training to urbanizing localities that have adopted erosion and sediment control, subdivision, drainage, stormwater, and other land development ordinances that address stormwater management.  Further, DCR staff directly review, approve, and oversee implementation of construction and maintenance plans for Best Management Practices (BMPs) on state agency projects to ensure compliance with the Regulations.  

Results will include subsequent improved status of reviewed local programs to gain compliance with state laws. Projects developed through the local watershed management planning process will be supported with tools and technical assistance provided by these positions. Staff will be involved in actively promoting the program during professional and citizen programs, events or other educational opportunities. Staff will be involved in local projects as needed and as assigned by regional office or program management to address situational issues or to provide design recommendations.

Biological sampling of aquatic macroinvertebrates and periphyton will be conducted in multiple TMDL project areas in 2011.  Site selection and sampling will be tied closely with 2011 sediment/habitat assessments in the Clark Fork – Silver Bow, Kootenai, Fisher, Rock and Thompson TMDL project areas.  The biological sampling will provide additional data to aid in TMDL development and overall stream assessment.  

Objectives
To sample representative populations of aquatic macroinvertebrates and periphyton in order to provide indicators of stream health and function in relation to sediment and habitat assessments being performed under different contracts.  

Methods
Macroinvertebrate and periphyton samples will be collected using the Environmental and Assessment Program (EMAP) method where 11 transects will be established on an identified stream reach.  Transects are equally spaced on the reach which is determined by the average wetted width from 5 representative cross-sections.  The average wetted width is multiplied by 40 to determine total reach length.  A kick net method will be used to collect the macroinvertebrate samples.  Periphyton will be collected by scraping substrate materials.  Alternate sections of the stream, will be sampled at each transect to yield 1 composite sample for macroinvertebrates and 1 composite sample for periphyton.  Analysis of the samples will be performed under a different contract.

Moose Pond, located in the towns of Bridgton, Denmark, and Sweden in both Oxford and Cumberland Counties, Maine, is currently listed on the Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s (MDEP) Nonpoint Source Priority Watershed list. The Pond has a surface area of 1,617 acres and a volume of 30,722 acre-feet with a mean depth of 20 feet and a maximum depth of 80 feet. The Pond’s watershed covers 11,170 acres and is part of the larger Saco River Watershed. Moose Pond has three distinct basins: upper, middle, and lower. The flushing rates for these basins are 4.97, 1.04, and 6.34 flushes per year, respectively. All three watershed towns (Bridgton, Denmark, and Sweden) have Comprehensive Plans approved by the State Planning Office. 
Moose Pond is a highly valued waterbody for fishing, boating and swimming. The Pond has two public boat launches located on Route 302 in Bridgton and one on the Lake Road in Denmark. It also has a scenic public picnic/rest area on Route 302 in Bridgton and a campground on Mountain Road in Denmark. Highly valued for its large and smallmouth bass fishery, Moose Pond is home to yearly bass tournaments. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife used to stock Moose Pond with lake trout and currently stock the pond with salmon.  
Lakes Environmental Association (LEA) has supported the Moose Pond community since the mid-1970’s. In addition to working with volunteers to regularly monitor the water quality of the Pond, LEA maintains courtesy boat inspectors at launches and also assisted landowners in forming the Moose Pond Association in 2008. With support of the Alpine Village Association and the Town of Bridgton, LEA recently applied for, and was granted, Maine Department of Transportation’s Surface Water Quality Protection Program funds to address sedimentation stemming from ditches along Route 302 in Bridgton. In addition, LEA designed and oversaw the installation of boat washing stations for both the southern and northern launches with funding from generous landowners and the Towns of Bridgton and Denmark. 
The Moose Pond Association (MPA) is actively working to maintain and improve Moose Pond. They fund boat inspectors to prevent invasive aquatic plants from entering Moose Pond, conduct surveys to monitor for invasive aquatic plants and are currently working to reduce erosion along the Route 302 causeway caused by heavy recreational use. They also recently led an effort to preserve the scenic Caruso Island located just south of the Route 302 causeway. 
During the spring and summer of 2010, a study of the entire Moose Pond Watershed was conducted under the direction of Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District (CCSWCD) with assistance from MPA, LEA, and community volunteers. This survey was awarded by and funded through the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) through funds under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act to reduce water quality impacts due to Non-Point Source (NPS) pollution. Volunteers and technical staff identified 208 erosion sites all within the Towns of Bridgton and Denmark contributing polluted runoff into the Pond. The Town of Bridgton and Denmark are currently addressing 27 identified impact sites on Mountain Road this summer as they improve road drainage. CCSWCD and LEA will be providing technical assistance and oversight to the towns during this enterprise. MPA is also taking a proactive role in protecting the Pond’s water quality by distributing targeted letters to all property owners identified in the survey this summer. The letter will list specific impacts observed on the property and explain basic recommendations that can currently be done to address those problems. The intent of this letter is to continue to engage landowner involvement in addressing NPS pollution during this summer with hopes that the grant funds will be available next summer to offer extensive technical and financial assistance in directly improving the highest impact sites identified.

Water quality data for Moose Pond has been collected since 1976. The upper basin (north of Route 302), is considered to have above average water quality based on measures of Secchi Disk Transparencies, total phosphorus, and Chlorophyll-a. This portion of the Pond, located in the least developed area of the watershed, is also considered to have a low potential for nuisance algal blooms. The middle basin (located near the Bridgton/Denmark line) and the lower basin (near Wood Island), however, both show moderate dissolved oxygen depletion in deep areas of the Pond, which severely limits  habitat for the Pond’s cold water fishery and increases the risk of for internal phosphorus loading. Due to low dissolved oxygen in deep waters of Moose Pond during the late summer and the associated impact on cold water fish species such as salmon and trout, LEA currently categorizes Moose Pond as a moderate to high degree of concern. 
In 2010, CCSWCD along with MPA and LEA conducted a survey to identify specific NPS pollution problems in the watershed. Technical staff and volunteers identified 208 sites with soil erosion and uncontrolled runoff to the lake. Of these 208 sites, 23 were rated as having a high impact to water quality, 75 as medium impact, and 110 as low impact. Impacts predominantly consisted of the following land uses: residential (73 sites), town roads (34 sites), commercial (30 sites), driveways (24 sites), beach access (18 sites), and private roads (17 sites). Impacts were also identified at state roads (5 sites), trails or paths (3 sites), boat access (2 sites), construction site (1 site), and picnic site (1 site). All water quality impact sites identified were in the towns of Bridgton and Denmark. Common issues recorded included: surface erosion, lack of shoreline vegetation, shoreline erosion and/or undercutting, areas of bare soil/uncovered sand, roof runoff causing erosion, unstable water access, evidence of beach sand being brought in, shoulder erosion, clogged culverts, and unstable culvert inlets and outlets. The large number of impact sites identified in this survey is contributing to the amount of sediment and phosphorus washing into Moose Pond each year thus affecting the pond’s water quality.



Objectives
The primary purpose of this project is to significantly reduce erosion and export of sediment and phosphorus into Moose Pond. Conservation practices that reduce erosion and polluted runoff will be installed at 30 sites throughout the watershed. These improvements will reduce pollutant load to Moose Pond by more than 148 tons of sediment per year. In addition, the project will raise awareness about watershed problems and work to foster long-term watershed stewardship.

Methods
The Moose Pond Watershed Implementation Project will be managed by the Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District and guided by a steering committee.  Key partners include the CCSWCD, MPA, LEA, Oxford County Soil and Water Conservation District (OCSWCD), MDEP, and the towns of Bridgton, Denmark, and Sweden.  
Through this project, CCSWCD staff and volunteers will coordinate and install Best Management Practices (BMPs) at three private road sites, two state road sites, one town road site, and nine commercial impact sites. In addition, cash match and guidance will be available to carry out 15 residential conservation matching grants. Contracted technical assistance from LEA and OCSWCD will be arranged to help in addressing these sites. In total, conservation practices that reduce erosion and polluted runoff will be installed at 30 sites throughout the watershed. Remediating these sites in conjunction with the Town of Bridgton and Denmark currently fixing the highest impact sites on Mountain Road will address nearly half of all the high and medium impact sites identified in the 2010 survey. It is anticipated that up to two additional implementation phases will be needed to address all of the high and medium impact sites.  
Project opportunities and accomplishments will be showcased in presentations at the MPA’s Annual Meeting and to the towns of Bridgton and Denmark selectboards. A proactive presentation on residential BMPs will be given to attendees of the MPA’s Annual Meeting during Year 1 of the grant. MPA will follow up on letters sent out this summer by individually contacting property owners identified in the 2010 survey to offer free technical assistance. Advertisement of the project and its opportunities will be provided through the CCSWCD, OCSWCD, LEA, and MPA websites, in LEA’s and MPA’s newsletters, and in articles in local papers. A final project summary sheet will be produced upon completion of addressing all sites. This summary will be distributed to town boards, watershed residents, MPA’s newsletter and on MPA, LEA, and CCSWCD websites.  
CCSWCD will exercise best professional judgment in the selection, design and installation of BMPs for NPS sites.  Grantees will design and install BMPs at NPS sites according to design guidance described in Maine BMP guidance manuals or use other BMPs acceptable to the MDEP.
This project will be conducted in accordance with applicable quality assurance procedures in the DEP document “Maine Section 319 NPS Management Program Quality Assurance ProgramPlan”(http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docgrant/319.htm
In managing this project NPS Program grant funds will not be used to undertake, complete, or maintain erosion or storm water control work otherwise required by existing permits or orders.  Grantee will ensure that permits required for construction are secured prior to construction and BMPs are constructed in an acceptable manner, before reimbursing landowners according to applicable Cost Sharing Agreements.

Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The SF CWR Project will provide both measurable, direct water quality improvements and more intangible benefits
through education and public outreach.

Objectives
According to the TMDL, the primary target is to reduce sediment to help meet state water quality standards and to reduce stream temperatures to attain full support for designated use. Secondly, an enhanced riparian area will improve water quality by filtering nutrients and bacteria from runoff. And finally, outreach and education efforts associated with the project will increase public knowledge about water quality issues.

Methods
Our projects will focus on in-stream restoration activities such as bank re-sloping and stabilization. We will also focus on the establishment of riparian buffers.","Y","Project Implementation","17060305","170603050903","N","06/02/2010",NA,"<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:59505"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,"Sedimentation-Siltation",246261

Red Rock Creek is a 26,482 acre watershed, flowing into Cottonwood Creek at stream mile 7.0; which then flows into the South Fork of the Clearwater River. There are currently 16 separate worksites. Work will be with livestock feeding areas.

Objectives:
 Red Rock Creek was identified as needing a 64% reduction in sediment; 50% reduction in temperature (75% shade increase); 89% dissolved oxygen reduction; 93% phosphorus reduction and a 67% pathogen reduction. This project will implement practices that are consistent with the implementation plans and provide needed water quality benefits.

Methods:
Expected outcomes are implementing Livestock BMP practices on up to 16 worksites in Red Rock Creek watershed that will reduce or eliminate livestock access to streams, reduce sediment and pathogens transport to streams, provide off-stream watering, reduce roof runoff through lots, develop springs and watering options and to reduce overland flow through lots. These improvements will reduce the sediment, nutrients and pathogens directly. In time, temperature will be reduced through added shade; and the dissolved oxygen will be changed.

Goal: Implementation of strategies and programs to reduce the impacts of animal waste, land applied sewage sludge, and commercial fertilizer to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.

Introduction: Proper management of nutrients used in agriculture is critical to Virginia’s efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution of both surface and groundwater.  The mission of the nutrient management program is to encourage the proper use of fertilizers, manures, and sewage sludge in ways that reduce impacts to ground and surface waters.  DCR works to manage both urban and agricultural nutrients found in fertilizers, manure, municipal sewage sludge and other sources so that they retain their efficient use yet don't impair the quality of Virginia's ground and surface waters. DCR uses various strategies to encourage proper land application of fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge for agricultural and urban purposes. Thirteen nutrient management specialists stationed in DCR's regional offices provide direct technical assistance to farmers. They develop site-specific nutrient management plans with cooperating farmers, assist farmers with manure testing for nutrient levels, calibrate nutrient application equipment, and coordinate soil nitrate testing in agricultural crop fields


Objectives
Funding Use: Section 319(h) base funding will be used to support the Nutrient Management Program Manager and the Nutrient Management Training and Certification Coordinator, both based in the DCR, DSWC central office in Richmond. This work plan also funds 2.5 Nutrient Management Specialists. Two full-time and one part-time nutrient management specialists will be housed in agency watershed field offices. The funding of these positions is necessary to implement Objectives 1, 2, and 5 of the Agriculture Chapter in the Virginia Nonpoint Source Pollution Management Program Plan. .  In addition this project implements multiple objectives in Section B of Chapter 2 in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Waters Clean-up Plan. As directed by Federal grant guidance, these positions will not be directly involved in any of Virginia’s NPDES program responsibilities.

The DWQ Basinwide Management Plans stress the need for restoration work and corrective action in watersheds.  Each of the water bodies in this proposal is listed on the NC DENR, DWQ 2000 303(d) list as being impaired by sediment.  This project will address the severe sedimentation problems in the Contentnea, Bear and Chicod Creek watersheds by installing the necessary BMPs.  Lenoir, Pitt, and Greene SWCDs, along with NRCS and the DSWC will prioritize the necessary BMPs that are needed for the corrective actions in each watershed.

Objectives
The Agricultural Sediment Initiative will restore degraded waters by implementing best management prqactices (BMPs).  The BMPs listed in the budget will directly reduce sediment delivery to the listed impaired waters.  Other benefits can be expected as well, since many of the proposed BMPs will prevent off-site movement of pesticides, phosphorus, nutrients, and fecal coliform.  Improvement in stream bank stability and habitat for fish and macro invertebrates will also be realized.  All water bodies addressed in this proposal are included on North Carolina's 2000 303(d) list as impaired by sediment.  The main objective is removal of these water bodies from the NC 303(d) list.

Methods
Expected benefits of this project are to address and improve severe problems of the 303(d) listed water bodies included in the proposal.  By addressing these problems and using appropriate corrective actions we can greatly reduce sedimentation, as well as excess nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliform from the impaired waters.  The Soil and Water Conservation Districts will be conducting field assessments.  These calculations will estimate the reduction in soil loss and nutrient loss using the North Carolina Agricultural Assessment Tool and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation.

Full-time conservation technicians were established through funding provided by EPA 319 and the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The positions are needed to provide continued technical assistance to local citizens to implement the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico TMDLs and compile yearly-required reports. Providing additional technical assistance is desirable for natural resource conservation planning, landowner education on NPS pollutants, and the design, installation, and maintenance of agricultural best management practices and stormwater controls to achieve the desired nutrient loading goals in all three watersheds.

NC DWQ recognizes the need for conservation technicians in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins for assisting residents to implement and maintain nutrient reductions. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation will work cooperatively with each of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (districts), the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other state and federal partners to ensure success. Conservation technicians are county employees with offices located in local SWCD offices.  Specific duties of each conservation technician include outreach to residents, education, and installation and maintenance of agricultural and urban best management practices.
Watershed technician positions are needed in districts in order to assure consistent reporting for the agricultural rules in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  During the course of this project, the number of technicians employed in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins has been reduced to insure efficient use of funding, while still being able to provide valuable technical assistance and complete annual reporting activities. Where position technicians were not able to obtain additional local or state funding, districts have entered in contracts to receive small annual payments that are less expensive than the cost of a full-time technician, but still provide reporting assistance to the Local Advisories Committees.  

It is important to note that the agricultural rule strategies depend upon local advisory committees to complete annual reporting requirements to insure compliance and report progress with the goals of the rule.  The funding requested in this grant will allow for a coordinated system of annual reporting and focus on rule implementation, as there were no funds provided for local staff positions to assist in rule implementation.  These staff positions and contracts allow the State to receive consistent information from each county.  Although the local advisory committee members are appointed, they serve as volunteers.  Without local staff coordination, obtaining the most up-to-date and accurate information from 30 counties would be infeasible.  

The primary objective of this project is to employ fulltime conservation technicians to provide technical assistance to local citizens and landowners in natural resource conservation planning and best management practice (BMP) implementation to help meet the Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) strategies in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  Accelerated technical assistance is beneficial for natural resource conservation planning and BMP design, installation, and maintenance.  Having staff available locally to do this important work has helped agricultural operations achieve their nutrient reduction goals collectively in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  
 
The Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and the USDA-NRCS staff provide technical information, engineering assistance, and oversight of BMP installation.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation (DSWC) works with the districts using the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program (ACSP) infrastructure to provide SWCDs with matching salary funds for these technicians and for BMP contracts in these river basins.  

In December 1997, the EMC adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy (15A NCAC 2B.0238).  For the first time in state history, river basin rules were applied to agricultural nonpoint sources. The strategy is aimed at reducing the nitrogen load to the Neuse River Estuary from agricultural nonpoint sources by a minimum of 30 percent of the average annual load from the period 1991-1995 by August 2003.  The nitrogen reduction goal and management measures stated in the strategy also are mirrored in the TMDL for the Neuse Estuary.  The TMDL was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 2001.  The TMDL calls for continuing to implement the Neuse NSW Management Strategy.

A total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Pamlico Estuary was approved in 1995 based on a two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic model of the estuary from Greenville to Pamlico Point. The TMDL requires a 30% reduction in total nitrogen and no net increase in total phosphorus loading from the 1991 baseline year (DEM 1994). Since 1991, a voluntary program for agricultural nitrogen reduction has been underway resulting in approximately one-third of the cropland treated with nutrient reducing best management practices. In 1998, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) determined that agriculture had not made sufficient progress toward implementation of the TMDL and nutrient reduction targets. After a rulemaking process involving stakeholders and a legislative negotiation, Session Law 2001-355 was passed in 2001. The agricultural nutrient control strategy for the Tar-Pamlico was adopted by the EMC as 15A NCAC 2B .0256.  The session law and the rule require agricultural nutrient reductions according to the TMDL by September 1, 2006.  

Another important role of the watershed technician is implementing community conservation practices, and providing technical assistance and educational opportunities for all ages.  The technicians will be capable of designing and supervising the installation of basic stormwater BMPs such as grass swales, rain gardens, and stormwater wetland projects.  They will also have the opportunity to educate landowners, homeowner associations and school-aged children on the sources and effects of NPS pollution.   

The long-term objective of this proposal is to actively engage the technicians with local governments and Soil and Water Conservation Districts in addressing their nonpoint source pollution concerns.  Through education and outreach programs as well as technical assistance to all landowners, these technicians should become a vital asset to the counties they serve.  Demonstrating these technicians’ attributes to their host County will be a crucial element in achieving the local governments continual funding of the position.   There are some counties that have not been able to support a technician based on the limited funding available through the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program.  For those counties, we will enter into a service contract to insure that the nutrient strategy work is done and that each county is promoting nutrient management practices.  These contracts will allow all necessary data to be compiled for the required annual report at a lesser cost than hiring a full time technician.


Objectives
The local river basin technicians (319 currently supports 6 of the 7 positions depicted below) will be instrumental in working with citizens to learn more about nutrient reduction and encourage additional installation of best management practices. The three main categories of work they will do include: 
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.
2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies.
3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

 

These staff positions will have additional responsibilities, as described below:

	Coordinate efforts with other agency personnel to work in accordance with the Local Nutrient Reduction Strategy developed by LACs for the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.
	Implement the local strategy for the counties they serve and address incomplete items and conditional actions. 
	Complete NLEW runs for the annual report, spreadsheets for BMPs installed, and update local strategies each May. For strategies below the goal, develop and implement a plan for achieving goals. 
	Organize and participate in LAC meetings in coordination with LAC chair and district staff. 
	Document nutrient reducing BMPs. 
	Attend many of the Soil and Water Conservation District meetings and County Planning Meetings, where applicable, in each county to keep them informed of progress towards the nutrient reduction goals. 
	Work effectively with landowners, farmers and contractors in the installation of best management practices.
	Attend training provided through NRCS and others to learn how to install and plan nutrient reducing BMPs, complete the necessary training to become a Certified Nutrient Management Planner, and work towards becoming a Certified Conservation Planner. 
	Provide technical assistance to landowners to implement community conservation practices on their properties.
	Conduct outreach and environmental education programs.
	Contact landowners to advise them of regulatory requirements in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, options for complying with requirements, and opportunities available to assist in installation of nutrient reduction practices. 
	Collect information necessary to develop individual conservation farm plans for nutrient reduction in accordance with local, state and federal rules and policy, using standards and specifications of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Natural Resources Conservation Service or those adopted by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  
	Work with the District Conservationist or department head and other staff members to complete farm plans and write nutrient management plans.
	Incorporate existing and new federal and state cost share assistance programs in planning for best management practice implementation.  Assist with writing contracts and BMP planning with guidance of District Conservationist or department head.         
	Prepare necessary records and quarterly reports on work accomplished; maintain field office records and case files as required. 

Watershed Technicians have a significant role in conservation planning, developing cost share contracts, and writing nutrient management plans.  The role of technicians working with farmers to plan and install BMPs has increased due to limiting staffing and significant conservation funding.  The watershed technicians have been instrumental in accelerating BMP design and installation since they have been employed.  When looking at data since the baseline periods of the three strategies, the State’s Agriculture Cost Share Program has provided substantial support for BMP implementation.  Since 1992, a total of $24,099,930 has been spent through the NC Agricultural Cost Share program in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  This has resulted in 338,745 acres affected by BMPs, 4,900,138 pounds of N saved, 1,159,653 pounds of P saved and 1,157,774 tons of soil saved. The need for continued focus and BMP implementation in these basins is justified by the water quality monitoring data the state collects, which still indicates impairment.  


Methods
The measurable results of this project will be acres affected by BMPs, the tons of soil saved, and the pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus saved through the NC Agricultural Cost Share Program. Many of the farmers in the three watersheds participate in state and federal cost share programs.  All cost share programs require a landowner contribution to receive state or federal assistance, and many farmers install best management practices without government assistance.

The number of BMPs installed and the number of landowners participating in the project will measure the success of this project.  

An additional measurable result will be receiving the yearly annual reporting data from each local advisory committee so that each Basinwide annual report can be compiled
1.	Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.

2.	Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies. This includes the annual county reports produced by technicians that when compiled for the basin or watershed, provide a comprehensive summary of estimated nitrogen losses from cropland based on the Nutrient Loss Estimation Worksheet. Reports show progress by county toward achieving the 30% nitrogen reduction goal for both the Neuse and the Tar-Pamlico. In counties where the goal has already been achieved, technicians will track continued compliance and maintenance of the goal. Where progress is below goal expectations, technicians will work with farmers and agency representatives to determine likely opportunities for reductions and target technical and cost-share assistance where needed.

3.	Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

In December 1997, the Environmental Management Commission (EMC) adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy.  For the first time in state history, mandatory controls were applied not only on point source pollution, but also on nonpoint source pollution in the Neuse River basin. The strategy has eight rules that affect both urban and rural areas.  The strategy is aimed at reducing the average annual load of nitrogen delivered to the Neuse River Estuary from point and nonpoint source pollution by a minimum of 30% of the average annual load from the period 1991 through 1995 by the year 2003.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation has been heavily involved in the implementation and reporting of the agriculture rule.  

The Neuse agricultural rule provides each farmer with the option of becoming part of a collective local strategy for implementing BMPs or implementing standard BMPs as specified in the rule.  A Basin Oversight Committee and seventeen Local Advisory Committees were established to implement the Neuse agricultural rule and to assist farmers with complying with the rule.

The Falls Lake Reservoir encompasses the upper part of the Neuse River Basin.  Despite the regulatory nutrient management strategy in the Neuse River Basin, the Falls Lake Reservoir's water quality has continued to decline, and portions of the lake are now impaired for chorophyll-a and turbidity.  To address this water quality problem, additional water quality monitoring and modeling are underway as North Carolina prepares a total maximum daily load and plans to initiate a rule making process.  Since additional rules will impact the Falls Lake Watershed, it will be important for this position to assist the Division of Water Quality and the local soil and water conservation districts as the state develops a revised agricultural rule for this part of the Neuse River Basin.

In 2000, the Environmental Management Commission moved the nonpoint source side of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to a regulatory approach with the adoption of rules addressing agriculture, urban stormwater, nutrient management, and riparian buffer protection.  This rulemaking built on the precedent-setting Neuse effort three years earlier, which for the first time set regulatory reduction measures for nutrients on cropland acres in the state.  The agriculture rule supports the overall goals of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to reduce nitrogen loading to the Pamlico estuary by 30% from 1991 levels and to limit phosphorus loading to 1991 levels.

In addition, the EMC approved an innovative nutrient reduction strategy involving trading of pollution reduction credits between point and nonpoint sources.  In general, point sources can fulfill their nutrient reduction requirements using the most cost-effective method, including the option of funding implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs).

The main responsibility of the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Basin Coordinator is to facilitate nutrient load reduction from agricultural enterprises in order to meet the goal established in both the Neuse, Falls Lake (when adopted) and Tar-Pamlico agricultural rules.  In addition to helping local entities meet these goals, this position will be responsible for developing the annual agriculture reports for the EMC that are required by the rules.  This individual will also work closely with the NC Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), EPA, the Division of Water Quality (DWQ), and other divisions within the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) to promote and implement water quality efforts in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

"499","items",NA,"NC",67440,"R-2  CAFO Monitoring Study-Impact on Surface Water","$200,000","Overview
The practice of applying waste manure from swine CAFOs to agricultural fields is commonplace throughout the North Carolina Coastal Plain. In 2010, DWQ permitted approximately 2,150 swine operations in North Carolina, most of which are in the Coastal Plain. Research indicates that swine CAFOs have been shown to influence nutrient delivery to streams on small-scale site-specific studies; however, the overall impact to surface waters throughout the Coastal Plain is largely unknown. The lack of stream water-quality data associated with a large number of permitted swine CAFOs makes it difficult for DWQ to assess how well existing regulations protect the waters of the State or to even recommend effective changes to regulations or procedures.

Objectives
The proposed cooperative research between USGS and DWQ has an overall goal of generating needed information to provide a scientific basis for water-resource managers and policy makers to evaluate existing, or establish new, regulations or procedures at permitted swine CAFOS for protecting and enhancing stream water quality in nutrient impaired waters in eastern North Carolina. The primary objective of this investigation is to initiate a water-quality sampling study to characterize stream nutrient concentrations associated with swine CAFOs in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. These CAFOs will be representative of the approximately 2,000 swine CAFOs permitted by DWQ that are located in the Coastal Plain (fig. 1).
It is understood that many environmental factors influence the quantity of nutrients delivered to Coastal Plain streams. Some important factors include differences in nutrient contributions from both point and nonpoint sources of nutrients, land use, soil types, best management practices (BMPs), hydrogeologic setting, storm-water runoff, groundwater discharge, and geochemical processes. The proposed study is not intended to evaluate relative contributions of different nutrient sources or transport mechanisms and geochemical processing that influence the overall amounts of nutrients delivered to streams having swine CAFOs. The proposed project will attempt to document whether swine CAFOs located in Coastal Plain watersheds have a measurable effect on surface water nutrient concentrations. Part of the study focus will be to evaluate groupings of CAFOs based on site attributes (such as density of swine animals, size of waste application fields, or presence of tile drainage) to examine potential correlations between CAFO site characteristics and stream nutrient concentrations. These correlations may be useful for identifying common characteristics associated with swine CAFOs when measured effects on stream nutrients are observed, and thus, providing information to support development of strategies intended to reduce potential nutrient loadings from swine CAFOs to receiving streams. The proposed study primarily focuses on nutrients because of ongoing efforts to improve water-quality conditions in nutrient sensitive waters in the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Data for other water-quality constituents including field parameters and selected major ions will be collected and used to characterize potential effects of swine CAFOs on surface-water quality.
The objectives for this investigation are as follows:
• Develop a subset of the 2,150 permitted swine CAFOs in North Carolina for use in water-quality sampling that are representative of swine CAFOs located in the Coastal Plain;
• Measure and compare stream concentrations of nutrients and select ions at swine CAFOs grouped on the basis of site operational or environmental attributes;
• Analyze and summarize the data to characterize potential impacts of swine CAFOs on receiving.

Methods
This study will be conducted by the USGS in cooperation with DWQ. The proposed work will include collection of field water-quality parameters and -samples for laboratory analysis of nutrients (dissolved nitrite plus nitrate, dissolved ammonia, total ammonia plus organic nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus) and dissolved ions (chloride, sodium, and potassium) in various streams with swine CAFOs throughout eastern North Carolina. The scope of work for this proposal extends over a 3-year period, beginning in April 2011 and ending in March 2014. Selection of study sampling sites and field data collection activities will be conducted during the first two years. Given that there are over 2,000 permitted swine CAFOs in North Carolina, it is impractical to sample all facilities based on available financial and personnel resources. Compilation of chemical data necessary for better understanding whether effects of swine CAFOs on surface-water quality can be measured will first require selection of a subset of the permitted swine CAFOS for use in data collection and analysis. Available site attribute information for the permitted CAFOs (such as number of animals and size of waste application fields) will be used with GIS analysis for developing a network of sampling sites that 1) can feasibly be sampled given available resources, and 2) is representative of swine CAFOs found in the Coastal Plain. About 96 to 112 swine CAFO sites are anticipated to be included in the study. Subsequent to developing the network of sampling sites, three rounds of water-quality samples will be collected from each site for laboratory analysis of nutrients and ions. Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine if there are significant differences in measured nutrient concentrations at the stream study sites and to examine potential correlations between CAFO site attributes and stream nutrient concentrations. In the final year of the project, the USGS will develop a final project report that presents and evaluates the study results.","N","Project Implementation","03020103","030201030605","N","07/01/2011","Completed","<a href=""https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/grts/f?p=grts:700:::NO:RP,700:P700_PRJ_SEQ:67440"" target=""_blank"">VIEW</a>",NA,NA,NA,2e+05

In December 1997, the Environmental Management Commission (EMC) adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy.  For the first time in state history, mandatory controls were applied not only on point source pollution, but also on nonpoint source pollution in the Neuse River basin. The strategy has eight rules that affect both urban and rural areas.  The strategy is aimed at reducing the average annual load of nitrogen delivered to the Neuse River Estuary from point and nonpoint source pollution by a minimum of 30% of the average annual load from the period 1991 through 1995 by the year 2003.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation has been heavily involved in the implementation and reporting of the agriculture rule.  

The Neuse agricultural rule provides each farmer with the option of becoming part of a collective local strategy for implementing BMPs or implementing standard BMPs as specified in the rule.  A Basin Oversight Committee and seventeen Local Advisory Committees were established to implement the Neuse agricultural rule and to assist farmers with complying with the rule.

The Falls Lake Reservoir encompasses the upper part of the Neuse River Basin.  Despite the regulatory nutrient management strategy in the Neuse River Basin, the Falls Lake Reservoir's water quality has continued to decline, and portions of the lake are now impaired for chorophyll-a and turbidity.  To address this water quality problem, additional water quality monitoring and modeling are underway as North Carolina prepares a total maximum daily load and plans to initiate a rule making process.  Since additional rules will impact the Falls Lake Watershed, it will be important for this position to assist the Division of Water Quality and the local soil and water conservation districts as the state develops a revised agricultural rule for this part of the Neuse River Basin.


Objectives
In 2000, the Environmental Management Commission moved the nonpoint source side of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to a regulatory approach with the adoption of rules addressing agriculture, urban stormwater, nutrient management, and riparian buffer protection.  This rulemaking built on the precedent-setting Neuse effort three years earlier, which for the first time set regulatory reduction measures for nutrients on cropland acres in the state.  The agriculture rule supports the overall goals of the Tar-Pamlico nutrient strategy to reduce nitrogen loading to the Pamlico estuary by 30% from 1991 levels and to limit phosphorus loading to 1991 levels.

In addition, the EMC approved an innovative nutrient reduction strategy involving trading of pollution reduction credits between point and nonpoint sources.  In general, point sources can fulfill their nutrient reduction requirements using the most cost-effective method, including the option of funding implementation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs).

The main responsibility of the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Basin Coordinator is to facilitate nutrient load reduction from agricultural enterprises in order to meet the goal established in both the Neuse, Falls Lake (when adopted) and Tar-Pamlico agricultural rules.  In addition to helping local entities meet these goals, this position will be responsible for developing the annual agriculture reports for the EMC that are required by the rules.  This individual will also work closely with the NC Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), EPA, the Division of Water Quality (DWQ), and other divisions within the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) to promote and implement water quality efforts in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.

"501","items",NA,"NC",81881,"I-8  Technical Assistance for the NPS NSW Strategies (Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins)","$197,200","Overview
Full-time conservation technicians were established through funding provided by EPA 319 and the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The positions are needed to provide continued technical assistance to local citizens to implement the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico TMDLs and compile yearly-required reports. Providing additional technical assistance is desirable for natural resource conservation planning, landowner education on NPS pollutants, and the design, installation, and maintenance of agricultural best management practices and stormwater controls to achieve the desired nutrient loading goals in all three watersheds.

NC DWQ recognizes the need for conservation technicians in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins for assisting residents to implement and maintain nutrient reductions. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation will work cooperatively with each of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts (districts), the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other state and federal partners to ensure success. Conservation technicians are county employees with offices located in local SWCD offices.  Specific duties of each conservation technician include outreach to residents, education, and installation and maintenance of agricultural and urban best management practices.

Objectives
Watershed technician positions are needed in districts in order to assure consistent reporting for the agricultural rules in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  During the course of this project, the number of technicians employed in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins has been reduced to insure efficient use of funding, while still being able to provide valuable technical assistance and complete annual reporting activities. Where position technicians were not able to obtain additional local or state funding, districts have entered in contracts to receive small annual payments that are less expensive than the cost of a full-time technician, but still provide reporting assistance to the Local Advisories Committees.  

It is important to note that the agricultural rule strategies depend upon local advisory committees to complete annual reporting requirements to insure compliance and report progress with the goals of the rule.  The funding requested in this grant will allow for a coordinated system of annual reporting and focus on rule implementation, as there were no funds provided for local staff positions to assist in rule implementation.  These staff positions and contracts allow the State to receive consistent information from each county.  Although the local advisory committee members are appointed, they serve as volunteers.  Without local staff coordination, obtaining the most up-to-date and accurate information from 30 counties would be infeasible.  

The primary objective of this project is to employ fulltime conservation technicians to provide technical assistance to local citizens and landowners in natural resource conservation planning and best management practice (BMP) implementation to help meet the Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) strategies in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  Accelerated technical assistance is beneficial for natural resource conservation planning and BMP design, installation, and maintenance.  Having staff available locally to do this important work has helped agricultural operations achieve their nutrient reduction goals collectively in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  
 
The Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and the USDA-NRCS staff provide technical information, engineering assistance, and oversight of BMP installation.  The Division of Soil and Water Conservation (DSWC) works with the districts using the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program (ACSP) infrastructure to provide SWCDs with matching salary funds for these technicians and for BMP contracts in these river basins.  

In December 1997, the EMC adopted the Neuse River Basin Nutrient Sensitive Waters (NSW) Management Strategy (15A NCAC 2B.0238).  For the first time in state history, river basin rules were applied to agricultural nonpoint sources. The strategy is aimed at reducing the nitrogen load to the Neuse River Estuary from agricultural nonpoint sources by a minimum of 30 percent of the average annual load from the period 1991-1995 by August 2003.  The nitrogen reduction goal and management measures stated in the strategy also are mirrored in the TMDL for the Neuse Estuary.  The TMDL was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 2001.  The TMDL calls for continuing to implement the Neuse NSW Management Strategy.

A total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the Pamlico Estuary was approved in 1995 based on a two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic model of the estuary from Greenville to Pamlico Point. The TMDL requires a 30% reduction in total nitrogen and no net increase in total phosphorus loading from the 1991 baseline year (DEM 1994). Since 1991, a voluntary program for agricultural nitrogen reduction has been underway resulting in approximately one-third of the cropland treated with nutrient reducing best management practices. In 1998, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) determined that agriculture had not made sufficient progress toward implementation of the TMDL and nutrient reduction targets. After a rulemaking process involving stakeholders and a legislative negotiation, Session Law 2001-355 was passed in 2001. The agricultural nutrient control strategy for the Tar-Pamlico was adopted by the EMC as 15A NCAC 2B .0256.  The session law and the rule require agricultural nutrient reductions according to the TMDL by September 1, 2006.  

Another important role of the watershed technician is implementing community conservation practices, and providing technical assistance and educational opportunities for all ages.  The technicians will be capable of designing and supervising the installation of basic stormwater BMPs such as grass swales, rain gardens, and stormwater wetland projects.  They will also have the opportunity to educate landowners, homeowner associations and school-aged children on the sources and effects of NPS pollution.   

The long-term objective of this proposal is to actively engage the technicians with local governments and Soil and Water Conservation Districts in addressing their nonpoint source pollution concerns.  Through education and outreach programs as well as technical assistance to all landowners, these technicians should become a vital asset to the counties they serve.  Demonstrating these technicians’ attributes to their host County will be a crucial element in achieving the local governments continual funding of the position.   There are some counties that have not been able to support a technician based on the limited funding available through the NC Agriculture Cost Share Program.  For those counties, we will enter into a service contract to insure that the nutrient strategy work is done and that each county is promoting nutrient management practices.  These contracts will allow all necessary data to be compiled for the required annual report at a lesser cost than hiring a full time technician.


Methods
The local river basin technicians (319 currently supports 6.5 positions) will be instrumental in working with citizens to learn more about nutrient reduction and encourage additional installation of best management practices. The three main categories of work they will do include: 
1. Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.
2. Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies.
3. Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

The local river basin technicians currently support the following counties:
 Michael Dupree: Upper Neuse/Falls Lake/Upper Tar in Durham, Person, Orange & Granville Counties
Charles Dunevant: Upper Neuse/Falls Lake/Upper Tar in Wake, Franklin, Vance & Warren Counties
Josh Pate: Mid Neuse/Mid Tar in Nash, Halifax & Wilson Counties
Andy Miller: Mid Neuse in Johnston & Wayne Counties
Paul (PJ) Andrews: Mid Neuse/Mid Tar in Pitt, Martin, & Lenoir Counties
Brandon Marshall: Lower Tar in Hyde, Beaufort & Washington Counties
Caroline Sisley: Lower Neuse in Jones County (only ½ time support)
The Edgecombe, Greene, Carteret, Pamlico & Craven are supported by contracts because they are unable to support a full time technician.

These staff positions will have additional responsibilities, as described below:

 Coordinate efforts with other agency personnel to work in accordance with the Local Nutrient Reduction Strategy developed by LACs for the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.
 Implement the local strategy for the counties they serve and address incomplete items and conditional actions. 
 Complete NLEW runs for the annual report, spreadsheets for BMPs installed, and update local strategies each May. For strategies below the goal, develop and implement a plan for achieving goals. 
 Organize and participate in LAC meetings in coordination with LAC chair and district staff. 
 Document nutrient reducing BMPs. 
 Attend many of the Soil and Water Conservation District meetings and County Planning Meetings, where applicable, in each county to keep them informed of progress towards the nutrient reduction goals. 
 Work effectively with landowners, farmers and contractors in the installation of best management practices.
 Attend training provided through NRCS and others to learn how to install and plan nutrient reducing BMPs, complete the necessary training to become a Certified Nutrient Management Planner, and work towards becoming a Certified Conservation Planner. 
 Provide technical assistance to landowners to implement community conservation practices on their properties.
 Conduct outreach and environmental education programs.
 Contact landowners to advise them of regulatory requirements in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, options for complying with requirements, and opportunities available to assist in installation of nutrient reduction practices. 
 Collect information necessary to develop individual conservation farm plans for nutrient reduction in accordance with local, state and federal rules and policy, using standards and specifications of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Natural Resources Conservation Service or those adopted by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  
 Work with the District Conservationist or department head and other staff members to complete farm plans and write nutrient management plans.
 Incorporate existing and new federal and state cost share assistance programs in planning for best management practice implementation.  Assist with writing contracts and BMP planning with guidance of District Conservationist or department head.          
 Prepare necessary records and quarterly reports on work accomplished; maintain field office records and case files as required. 

Watershed Technicians have a significant role in conservation planning, developing cost share contracts, and writing nutrient management plans.  The role of technicians working with farmers to plan and install BMPs has increased due to limiting staffing and significant conservation funding.  The watershed technicians have been instrumental in accelerating BMP design and installation since they have been employed.  When looking at data since the baseline periods of the three strategies, the State’s Agriculture Cost Share Program has provided substantial support for BMP implementation.  Since 1992, a total of $24,099,930 has been spent through the NC Agricultural Cost Share program in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins.  This has resulted in 338,745 acres affected by BMPs, 4,900,138 pounds of N saved, 1,159,653 pounds of P saved and 1,157,774 tons of soil saved. The need for continued focus and BMP implementation in these basins is justified by the water quality monitoring data the state collects, which still indicates impairment.  In 2008-2010 there were BMPs installed with the help of the local river basin technicians which total $5,673,765 and covering 690,642 acres.  The counties’ requests for BMP funds continually exceed the monies available each year.  This is evidence of the continual need by farmers for BMPs in this region.
1. Provide technical assistance to local citizens to achieve nutrient reduction.

2. Document nutrient reductions consistent with local strategies. This includes the annual county reports produced by technicians that when compiled for the basin or watershed, provide a comprehensive summary of estimated nitrogen losses from cropland based on the Nutrient Loss Estimation Worksheet. Reports show progress by county toward achieving the 30% nitrogen reduction goal for both the Neuse and the Tar-Pamlico. In counties where the goal has already been achieved, technicians will track continued compliance and maintenance of the goal. Where progress is below goal expectations, technicians will work with farmers and agency representatives to determine likely opportunities for reductions and target technical and cost-share assistance where needed.

3. Conduct outreach and education to farmers and local citizens on nutrient reductions and BMP options.

Nevada Outdoor School (NOS) seeks to reach students and educators with educational outreach to better understand their local watershed and non-point source pollution.  
This program will teach students what a watershed is, how it benefits communities, why clean water 
is important, how natural and man-made “systems” in a watershed are connected and how individual choices impact the future health of our water. The program will encourage youth and adult learners in rural Nevada to explore the outdoors and learn about science-based watershed education.  With this funding, students in rural Nevada experience their watershed and understand the potential impact of NPS pollution.  


Objectives
This Nevada Outdoor School endeavors to teach an understanding of the impact of NPS water pollution and to create responsible watershed stewards. To this end, it is essential to include  

o	ActionEducationTM - defined as education that empowers learners to take positive and 
appropriate action to solve a local water resource issue.
o	Stewardship - defined as taking steps to make a positive difference. Watershed stewardship, 
therefore, involves ActionEducationTM  to improve the health of a local watershed.

•	1000 students participate in classroom science lessons about water, watersheds and NPS pollution.
•	500 students participate in NOS led field trips to local waterways, with water quality testing, watershed models, run-off demonstrations.
•	10 educators participate in a Project W.E.T. workshop and share at least one activity with their own students within 90 days.  An additional 100 students will be reached with those activities.
•	20 students and 2 educators will be involved in seeding, growing and planting native species to help with the recovery of a burned area adjacent to their school in the small community of Paradise Valley, NV.   


Methods
Task 1:	 Nevada Outdoor School visits, on average, 70 classrooms each month during the school year.  
At least 50 lessons during the year will involve topics in water, watersheds and NPS pollution.  
Task 2:  Nevada Outdoor School will expand their watershed field trip initiative targeted to 2nd grade students with similar curriculum that teaches science-based watershed education to other communities beyond Winnemucca, using the local watershed as a model.  The watershed field trip will encourage youth and adult learners in rural Nevada to explore the outdoors. Field trips will be offered to schools in Winnemucca, Paradise Valley, Orovada (includes Kings River and McDermitt) and Elko.  
Task 3:  A Project W.E.T workshop will be offered to rural Nevada educators, to take place in Winnemucca, in the spring of 2013.  NOS’s Director of Programming will coordinate with the state Project W.E.T. Director to implement the training. The workshop will teach educators what a watershed is, how it benefits communities, why clean water is important, how natural and man-made “systems” in a watershed are connected and how individual choices impact the future health of our water. 
Task 4: Nevada Outdoor School will install a temporary green house at Paradise Valley School and work with students and teachers to raise bitterbrush seedlings through the winter to be planted in spring 2013.  Friends of Nevada Wilderness will work with NOS to facilitate seed collection as well as coordinate the planting projects.  The fire damage has a direct impact on the surface water quality in Paradise Valley and is a learning opportunity for the students, as well as, a chance for them to make a big difference as stewards in their community.  The planting and restoration work of the Hanson fire will call on volunteers from the general public as well.  This activity will directly reduce NPS pollution of soil erosion as re-vegetation is crucial for wildlife and riparian habitat.

 Revised effective May 7, 2012 with the second amendment.

The goal of the Lewis and Clark Watershed Implementation Project is to restore the beneficial uses in Lewis and Clark Lake, and the watersheds of Lewis and Clark Lake, Geddes, Academy, Platte Lake and Lake Andes Lake.  This will be accomplished through the installation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the watersheds that target sources of sediment, nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Initiated during 2006, Project Segment I targeted BMPs only in the 56,000 acre Corsica Lake subwatershed.  In 2007 the Segment I Expansion added the East River portion of the watershed with 747,000 acres.  This project, Segment III, will properly address and target BMP installation in the entire South Dakota portion of the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed (1.9 million acres) and will also provide technical and financial assistance to the watershed activities in the Lake Andes, Geddes, Academy and Platte Lake Watersheds.  These additional four watersheds add up to 560,000 additional acres and are tributaries of the Missouri River and Lake Francis Case which lies upriver and borders the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed.  The total project area acreage is now 2,465,000 acres.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This proposal is the third segment of a locally planned multi-year (10-15 year) effort to implement best management practices (BMPs) in the Lewis and Clark Lake watershed, Lake Andes, Geddes, Academy and Platte Lake Watersheds.  This effort is aimed at restoring water quality to meet designated beneficial uses and address TMDLs established, and to be established, for water bodies in these watersheds.

The goal of the South Central Watershed Implementation Project is to restore or protect the beneficial uses in the Lower James River Watershed, Lewis and Clark Lake, and the watersheds of Geddes, Academy, Platte Lake and Lake Andes Lake.  This will be accomplished through the installation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the watersheds that target sources of sediment, nutrients, and fecal coliform bacteria.  This project, Segment I, will address and target BMP installation in the entire South Dakota portion of the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed (1.9 million acres), the Lower James River Watershed and its tributaries (2.6 million acres). It will also provide technical and financial assistance to the watershed activities in the Lake Andes, Geddes, Academy and Platte Lake Watersheds.  These additional four watersheds add up to 560,000 additional acres and are tributaries of the Missouri River and Lake Francis Case which lies upriver and borders the Lewis and Clark Lake Watershed.  The total project area acreage is 5,053,800 acres.  

Objectives
Objective 1:  Reduce nutrient, sediment and fecal coliform loadings in the South Central Watershed and the Lake Andes Watershed through the installation of Best Management Practices. 
Objective 2:  Provide project and BMP information to a minimum of 100 watershed landowners, 20 watershed organizations, and 2,500 area citizens to inform them of this project’s need and progress, and the results and recommendations from the Phase I Watershed Assessment. 
Objective 3:  Completion of water quality monitoring, monitor project progress and complete project administration and management to document project progress towards objectives and meet grant administration policy and guidelines.

Project Location:
The proposed project will implement TYN in the twelve communities currently participating in the program and fifteen additional communities that will be identified through this continued funding.  Six of the participating communities are delineated by county jurisdictions – Knox, Hamilton, Shelby, Cumberland, Davidson, and Montgomery. 
 The other six are MS4s located within Shelby County.

Within the six currently participating counties there are approximately 2,200 miles of stream segments unable to meet their designated uses due to impairments, according to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s (TDEC) 2008 303d list.  Of these impaired streams, 1,261 miles are impaired due to impacted by discharges from municipal separate storm sewer (MS4) discharges.
The 15 new communities brought into TYN will contain 303d streams, with priorities given to those listed for sediment/habitat alteration and nutrient impacts.  Additional criteria for the selection of these new communities will be determined through the implementation of this grant.

Project Background: An Educational Gap to Fill
The need for a residential program to address water quality issues associated with Tennessee’s burgeoning development arose from studies conducted in the rapidly urbanizing Beaver Creek Watershed located in North Knox County. One very telling study performed by the Tennessee Valley Authority indicated that nearly 40% of this 44 mile-long creek’s sediment load was coming from built-out residential areas, as was 12% of its phosphorus and 22% of its nitrogen loads. Visual assessments of neighborhoods in this watershed indicated that primary sources of sediment were bare lawns, non-vegetated drainage ditches, and exposed soils in gardens and high use areas (i.e. dog pens, overflow parking, etc.).

Recognizing that homeowners needed to become engaged in addressing these water quality issues, the Beaver Creek Education Committee searched for a program being implemented in Tennessee that could fill this gap but found none.  It did, however, identify the Yards and Neighborhoods Program that looked like a prime candidate for meeting this need.  Yards and Neighborhoods was founded by the University of Florida (UF) and, at the time of the Committee implemented in North and South Carolina, Louisiana, and Kansas.   The Florida program is managed by Extension, as are the other state programs, and is now referred to as the Florida Friendly Landscaping Program.  In its second decade, FFL is currently implemented in over three-quarters of the Florida’s counties, heralding an impressive legacy of successes.  

Yards and Neighborhoods was designed by the UF Extension to be a comprehensive state program that promotes environmentally friendly landscaping practices, with an emphasis on conserving water and protecting and improving waterways. It was also structured to accommodate the needs of the homeowner, providing a flexible approach to landscaping rather than prescriptive one using nine core sustainable landscape principles to guide homeowner actions.   In addition, an underlying set of behavior modification strategies were incorporated to support the program’s ultimate goal of behavior change.  These included having specific lists of actions associated with each of the nine principles that could be achieved over time.  These behaviors are understandable, incremental, and achievable – all critical components in efforts to change pre-established habits and behaviors.


Tennessee’s Changing Landscape & Impacted Waterways
After an extensive assessment of the Yards and Neighborhoods programs, it became evident that this program had the potential to fill a vital niche in Tennessee’s stormwater educational efforts.  The Beaver Creek Watershed with its rapid loss of farmland and declining water quality simply served as a looking glass for the development trends and water quality conditions across the state. For example, between 2002 and 2007, according to the Tennessee Dept. of Agriculture, 791,000 acres of the state’s farmland were lost to development (http://www.farmlandinfo.org/agricultural_statistics/index.cfm?function=statistics_view&stateID=TN).   In addition, between 1981 and 2007, Tennessee was ranked as 7th in the nation for the loss of prime farmland acreage (http://www.farmlandinfo.org/documents/38415/FIC_NRI_2007_Data_Tables.pdf).    With the state’s increasing population (i.e., a 30% increase between the 1990 and 2009 census), this trend is not likely to reverse.  Almost three-quarters of Tennesseans now live in our state’s 10 largest metropolitan areas, where 79% of our jobs are located and the majority of our gross domestic product (83%) is produced (http://www.brookings.edu/projects/blueprint/states/tennessee.aspx).  

As a result of this rapid development, the conditions of Tennessee’s waterbodies have markedly suffered.  According to the TDEC’s 2010 305b report residential development in rapidly urbanizing areas has become a primary water quality threat to our state’s waterways, particularly in Middle Tennessee. In addition, this report estimated that nearly 2,300 miles of Tennessee rivers and reservoirs have been impacted by discharges from MS4 communities.  These regulated growth areas encompass four of the largest municipalities in Tennessee and 78 smaller cities and counties.  In addition, the 305b report estimated that sediment is currently impacting about 6,000 stream miles and nitrate and phosphates are impacting 1,500 and 1,800 stream miles, respectively.

2006-2007 Creation and Pilot of TYN
As the first step toward determining the feasibility of establishing a Yards and Neighborhoods Program in Tennessee, a small-scale pilot was planned under the leadership of the TN WRRC, TVA, and UT Extension.  Materials were adapted for Tennessee’s ecology, stormwater issues, and landscaping habits.  A key change to the Yards and Neighborhood’s core principles included incorporating a principle related to appropriate turf management.  With lawns being the most visible type of ground cover after buildings in urban environments and a potential source of sediment and nutrients, the TYN team felt it critical that landowners be educated on this topic.  Moreover, studies have shown that if properly managed, well establish turf can reduce overall run off and nutrient losses (Stier, JC. and D.J. Soldat, 2011).

The initial training that the TYN team developed took the form of a six-hour TYN Homeowner Landscape Workshop.  Its format was based on homeowner workshop being conducted by the Carolina Yards & Neighborhoods.  In 2007 and 2008, six of these workshops were implemented in two watersheds in East Tennessee.  They were co-taught by an Extension agent and a water resource professional, with the participants’ understanding that there feedback would be sought.  Minor workshop modifications were made in response to this feedback, but input on the content and delivery approach was predominantly highly favorable.   

During this pilot period, meetings were also conducted with anticipated long-term key partners.  UT Extension administrators confirmed their support and saw TYN as an opportunity to address the needs of their shifting clientele-base with the urbanization of Tennessee’s landscapes.  Local communities likewise saw TYN as an ideal way to reach a target audience critical to the overall reduction of NPS pollutants entering their waterways.         
2008 - TYN Conducts Statewide Pilot
With demonstrated potential and momentum, the next chapter in TYN’s development involved implementing this program on a statewide basis.  The TYN Team -- TN WRRC, TVA, UT Extension --sought and received TDA 319 funds to conduct a pilot, involving five counties across the state:  Knox, Hamilton, Cumberland, Shelby, and Montgomery.  A TYN administrative structure was formed for the program’s management and delivery (see Appendix B).  This included a statewide management team, an advisory board (see Appendix C), and at the local level, county Extension agents teaming up with the local municipal water resource professionals to implement the workshops.  In total, 30 6-Hour Homeowner Landscape Workshops were implemented over the grant period, with approximately 400 homeowners having participated in them.   In addition, the following grant milestones were accomplished: 
•	A Train-the-Trainer (TTT) Workshop was conducted for 25 TYN trainers (Extension Agents, Stormwater staff and Master Gardeners) with favorable ratings by participants (Table 3)
•	A dynamic TYN Website was created through UT Extension using Sharepoint software.
•	A comprehensive programmatic evaluation was developed and implemented.
•	A marketing package was created for local communities.
•	Two additional educational modules were developed:   
A rain barrel module with three types of trainings including a rain barrel making workshop
A module for homeowner associations (HOAs), focusing on promoting neighborhood wide application of stormwater strategies.
Other major accomplishments included broadening participating communities.  Davidson and Roane Counties were trained in October of 2010 and that November, a group of MS4s (Collierville, City of Memphis, Millington, Bartlett and Lakeland) located in Shelby County also participated in a TTT Workshop.   Bringing in this group of communities allowed the TYN state management team to evaluate the effectiveness of joint marketing among municipalities which resultantly proved to be quite effective.  

The marketing and outreach efforts of the TYN program expanded as well.  A monthly electronic newsletter using the Constant Contact service was initiated and has been well received.   The TYN program also started using the social media outlet, Facebook, which has become increasingly useful as the TYN team has learned how to effectively use it and grow a network.  



Objectives
This project will geographically and programmatically expand the delivery of the TYN program that: 1) has been shown to effectively modify homeowner behavior in applying water conservation practices and taking actions that reduce nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant impacts on Tennessee waterways; 2) meets a critical need of involving landowners in stormwater solutions; and 3) is not replicated by any other program across the state.    

Methods
The scope of this proposed project builds upon TYN’s past accomplishments, including a sound statewide administrative structure, an effective educational approach and a network of supporting partners.  With this solid foundation, TYN is primed to expand both geographically and programmatically;  to bolster its marketing and participant retention strategies; and to implement a strategic planning process to move towards becoming a self-sustaining program.  

 Our approach to achieving these goals is laid out in task-wise format under the following three focal areas: 1) geographic and programmatic expansion; 2) demonstration project installation; 3) and evaluation through tracking participation. Following is a summary statement of each focal area followed by more detailed task-by-task descriptions.

"518","items",NA,"AR",46824,"Cross County Erosion Control Project","$450,000","Overview
Project implementation will be accomplished through the Cross County Conservation District.  Irrigation water conveyance (NRCS Code 430) and structure for water control (NRCS Code 587) will be the best management practices implemented in this project to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  Practice 430 reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution compared to more traditional irrigation methods by 1) replacing other types of conveyances (e.g., ditches or channels) and 2) allowing for a more even distribution of water across the field.  Using pipeline instead of a ditch to move water reduces the movement of sediment, which increases water quality.  Also, the use of pipeline allows for a more even distribution of water across the field, which decreases runoff, thus increasing water quality as well.  Practice 587 (i.e., drop-pipes) this practice is identified in ANRC’s 9 element plan as a priority BMP for the L’Anguille.  It reduces the potential for nonpoint source pollution and increases water quality compared to unmanaged runoff from fields by 1) trapping sediment, 2) reducing gully erosion and 3) managing downstream runoff.  Installing drop-pipes stabilizes the grade where the field’s water runs off, therefore controlling erosion and preventing the formation of gullies, thus increasing water quality.  In addition to the environmental benefits (increased water quality) from these practices, landowners in the District will also benefit economically as well from the more efficient transport of water, therefore reducing water usage costs.

To achieve the goal of reducing erosion from field runoff, pipe will be installed both above ground and/or underground in the L’Anguille River and Lower St. Francis River watersheds within Cross County.  The pipes are structures used to control the water level and release of water in irrigated fields.  Their purpose is to prevent erosion, increase water quality, reduce damage to the land, make possible proper management of irrigation water and reduce water conveyance losses.  The installation of approximately 115,600 feet of pipe and pipe structures will affect 31,380 acres of land.  The expected minimum lifespan of these pipes is 20 years, depending on the type installed (e.g., steel, corrugated metal, etc.).  The District is making a significant investment in this project and wants to maintain these pipes to increase and protect the water quality in the watershed.  The District will provide a map showing the location of installed pipes and acres of land protected as the project nears the end.  The district will administer the operations of the project, assisting project participants with the requirements necessary to meet NRCS specifications reflected from the guidelines received from the NRCS technician.   Also, the district will monitor the purchase of the specified materials to meet NRCS requirements.  The district will also require that each participant sign a cooperative agreement that will be retained on file in the Cross County Conservation District office. The Distict will administer periodic checks until the end of the agreement period.  NRCS will provide technical assistance throughout the project.  The district will provide each participant with NRCS installation guidelines, Structure for Water Control (code 587, and/or Irrigation Water Conveyance (code 430DD) and along with NRCS will conduct periodical site visits during installations.  District personnel will gather latitude and longitude coordinates for installed practices and report those to ANRC.  

The conservation district will solicit landowners by means of newspaper, radio, newsletters and posting project information flyers in public places for participation in the project and will administer an application sign up period.  

Approximately 76% of the project management practices will be installed in the L’Anguille River Watershed while approximately 26% being installed in the Lower St. Francis Watershed.  This project will provide a significant amount of sediment control for Cross County.


Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 1) prevent erosion, 2) improve water quality, 3) decrease damage to the land and 4) reduce water conveyance losses through proper management of irrigation water.  Reducing erosion will reduce the amount of sediment entering the watershed, thus improving water quality.  Reducing or minimizing the amount of time water passes over the ground surface reduces the likelihood of erosion (i.e., sediment transport).  This will be accomplished by controlling the transmission, transference, recovery and reuse of water by use of above ground and/or underground piping.

The White Oak Bayou is listed on the Arkansas 303(d) list for dissolved oxygen, pH, copper and lead.  The monitoring effort will be focused to delineate loading of pollutants and potential sources of loading to the watershed.  Monitoring will include water quality sampling, flow measurement and NPS assessment, as well as evaluation of potential places to retrofit stormwater controls in the watershed.  Data collected during this project will be used by the City of Maumelle, the White Oak Bayou Wetlands Conservancy and its partners to identify the main NPS’s, develop an approach to address them and prepare a 9-element watershed management plan.

4.	Measures of Success: Completion of each task on time and in budget.

Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to collect sufficient data to develop a 9-element watershed management plan and to complete watershed education.  A key componenct of the assessment will be development and use of a SWAT model.  Collection of physio-chemical data from the major drainages in the White Oak Bayou watershed will be competed in an effort to augment existing data and to quantify loading of key pollutants (those affecting oxygen such as nutrients and turbidity (sediment) and metals) in the watershed and delineate possible sources of the pollutants.  Monitoring will include water sampling, flow measurement and NPS assessment.  In addition, a survey/analysis of the existing landscape will be completed to determine where effective BMPs and storm water treatment could be implemented to reduce pollutants from stormwater in key areas to the system.  Data collected during this project will be used by the City of Maumelle, the White Oak Bayou Wetlands Conservancy (WOBWC) and their partners in development of SWAT model and a 9-element watershed management plan for the White Oak Bayou.  The information collected during this study should be sufficient, when added to the existing Wetland Management Plan and all its data, to complete an actual 9-element Watershed Management Plan (WMP) for White Oak Bayou.  This plan can later be integrated into a WMP for the entire 8-digit HUC.

The existing wetland management plan already has several components of a WMP including, a monitoring component, a stressor/vulnerability assessment, a stakeholder group and an educational component, all of which can be used for watershed management and allow completion of a 9-element plan in an expedited manner.

The Campbell County Conservation District’s goal for the Little Powder and Belle Fourche Watershed Implementation Project Phase II is to reduce fecal coliform and bacteria loading into the Little Powder and Donkey Creek Watersheds, within Campbell County. Specifically areas that are listed as impaired for fecal coliform/ E.coli that exceed the recreational use standard. This will be accomplished through watershed planning, monitoring, source identification, outreach and education, and implementation of best management practices.

Objectives and Methods:
Identify cause(s) of E.coli contamination and non-attainment of primary recreation standard through water quality monitoring of Little Powder River, Donkey Creek, and Stonepile Creek. CCCD will obtain credible data (biological, chemical, and physical) through an approved Sample and Analysis Plan. Results from collected data will help to decrease bacteria loading within the Upper Belle Fourche and Little Powder Watersheds through watershed planning, and BMP implementation, so the state of Wyoming's water quality criteria for contact recreation and designated uses are fully supported.  

With an extensive watershed planning effort, the objectives of Phase II are to: 

1. Provide outreach and education to affected interested parties and the general public on non-point source and point source pollution along with BMP’s that can be implemented to assist Donkey Creek Sub-Watershed and Little Powder Watershed in meeting primary recreation standards. Outreach and education will be provided through a combination of press releases, newsletter articles, water quality information at Campbell County Fair, youth and adult educational opportunities.  

2-Press releases, 3-newsletter articles, water quality section at fair booth, youth education: non-point source, point source, watershed, and water quality. Teach water quality at 5th grade camp (850 students). Inform locally elected officials about water quality efforts through monthly board meetings and district hosted annual legislative function.

2. Collect credible data during primary recreation season for three years.  A total of three hundred (300) samples will be collected (biological, chemical, and physical) and sixty (60) samples for QA/QC at six sites within the Donkey Creek Sub-Watershed and two sites within Little Powder Watershed. This should generate two (2) geomeans per year for a total of six (6) geomeans per site over the life of the project. A total of fifty-five (55) samples for microbial source tracking at two (2) sites on Little Powder River and three (3) sites on Donkey Creek. Samples will be examined for the presence of human, avian, and canine bacteroides. Samples will be analyzed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method.  This will help CCCD gain knowledge about the contributors to the bacterial loading within each watershed.   

Amend the current SAP and QAPP.  Submit amendments to WDEQ for approval and make any necessary adjustments.  Update information to reflect any changes in sampling sites, protocols for sampling, new labeling requirements, and any references to outdated SOP information.  Credible data will be collected during primary recreation season over three years.  Samples will be collected at two sites on LPR and six sites on DC/SP.  A total of 300 samples will be taken which will result in a minimum of two geomeans per year per site. MST samples will be taken at 5 locations.  MST samples will be collected ten times per site for a total of 55 samples, including duplicates.  

3.  Reconvene the Little Powder River Steering Committee to review and update the existing Little Powder Watershed Plan. This will help to ensure a locally lead process that will identify the BMPs needed to make an impact on the watershed in years to come. 

Steering committee reconvene. Contact interested parties from previous committee and solicit new committee members.  Host meetings to review and revise existing plan. Provide opportunity for public comment on the revised plan.  Finalize the plan and submit to WDEQ for final approval.  Steering committee will provide guidance and aid in making BMP recommendations.

4.  Implement BMP’s throughout the Donkey Creek Sub-Watershed to aid in decreasing bacteria loading within the watershed.  Offer a cost share program for implementation of BMPs including animal feeding operation (AFO) projects, septic remediation, livestock water development, fencing riparian areas, and wintering BMPs. CCCD will work with the Donkey Creek Watershed Steering Committee to prioritize projects, so that projects with the highest potential impact are funded.  Collect all project information needed to produce estimated load reductions for each project and for Phase II as a whole.

Implement approximately 3 alternative watering systems, 2 septic system remediation, 1 AFO/ winter area BMPs, 1 fabricated wind break, and 1 riparian area buffer project. Advertise cost share program, produce information and applications perform project administration, contracting, and monitoring.

The primary goal of the project is the restoration of the recreational and aquatic life uses of the Turtle River and Larimore Dam reservoir through the implementation of Best Management Practices (BMP’s).  Separate use improvement goals will be established for the priority areas in the Turtle River watershed versus the watershed for the Larimore Dam reservoir.  The Turtle River Watershed priority areas have impairments for recreation, municipal and domestic uses, and fish and other aquatic biota.  For these priorotiy areas, the project will focus on the implementation of BMP’s that will restore the impaired beneficial uses by reducing concentrations/loadings of phosphorus, nitrogen, and fecal coliform.  Additional BMP will also be used to improve ripairan conditions and the associated Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) and Rapid Geomorphic Assessment (RGA) scores at the sites.  As a secondary focus, BMP’s which contribute to the reduction in the levels of cadmium, selenium, chloride, and arsenic, which occur naturally, will be given special consideration.  The recreational use of the Larimore Dam reservoir is threatened by nutrient loading and in-lake eutrophication.  To improve the recreational uses, a variety of BMP will be implemented to reduce nutrient (N&P) loadings to the reservoir.
